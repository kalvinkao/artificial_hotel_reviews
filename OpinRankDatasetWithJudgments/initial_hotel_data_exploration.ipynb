      "['Oct 12 2009 ', 'Nice trendy hotel location not too bad.', \"I stayed in this hotel for one night. As this is a fairly new place some of the taxi drivers did not know where it was and/or did not want to drive there. Once I have eventually arrived at the hotel, I was very pleasantly surprised with the decor of the lobby/ground floor area. It was very stylish and modern. I found the reception's staff geeting me with 'Aloha' a bit out of place, but I guess they are briefed to say that to keep up the coroporate image.As I have a Starwood Preferred Guest member, I was given a small gift upon-check in. It was only a couple of fridge magnets in a gift box, but nevertheless a nice gesture.My room was nice and roomy, there are tea and coffee facilities in each room and you get two complimentary bottles of water plus some toiletries by 'bliss'.The location is not great. It is at the last metro stop and you then need to take a taxi, but if you are not planning on going to see the historic sites in Beijing, then you will be ok.I chose to have some breakfast in the hotel, which was really tasty and there was a good selection of dishes. There are a couple of computers to use in the communal area, as well as a pool table. There is also a small swimming pool and a gym area.I would definitely stay in this hotel again, but only if I did not plan to travel to central Beijing, as it can take a long time. The location is ok if you plan to do a lot of shopping, as there is a big shopping centre just few minutes away from the hotel and there are plenty of eating options around, including restaurants that serve a dog meat!\"]\n",
      "['Sep 25 2009 ', 'Great Budget Hotel!', 'Stayed two nights at Aloft on the most recent trip to China. The hotel was very modern and clean. The room was spotless and a comfortable king sized bed (as far as soft beds go in China). The staff was very punctual and went out of the way to help my every need, including going to a store across the street to purchase a China Mobile SIM card for me. The buffet breakfast was okay, nothing to write home about. The 42 LCD screen had movies on demand for 20RMB and had a good selection of western channels including HBO, CNN, BBC, Star World etc The gym was small, had a selection of basic weights and one cable machine, there was however 6 new TechnoGym cardio machines with built in LCD TVs which were very good. The location is a bit out of the way to the central areas of Beijing, but it is better suited for my needs as I need to be in the Haidian district. Being SPG Platinum there were no upgrades to a better room, because Aloft has a policy of not doing any upgrades. The Sheraton next door is a much nicer hotel in my opinion (where I am writing this from now, with an upgraded room) but as far as bang for the buck, Aloft is a great place!']\n",
      "['Aug 4 2009 ', 'Excellent value - location not a big problem.', \"We stayed at the Aloft Beijing Haidian for 5 nights from July 17 - 22nd. There are lots of reviews that talk about the location being a problem but we knew this ahead of time and found that it really wasn't an issue. The longest we spent in a taxi was about 30 minutes. We never paid more than 50rmb for a taxi ride (which is about $8 Cdn) and that was to the Forbidden City. Given there are 4 in our family, it was no big deal at all.As for the rooms, they were clean, the beds comfortable, the wireless internet connection reliable and it was one of the few hotels we found in Beijing that would accomodate 2 adults and 2 children. We paid about $70 Cdn. per night. That's an amazing price.It's not meant to be a 5 star hotel so you can't go in expecting that. We found the reception staff generally very helpful and friendly. They aren't the fastest in the world but it wasn't unreasonable at all.The hotel manager made an effort to speak with us a few times and was extremely helpful and welcoming. Their breakfast buffet was quite good and reasonably priced. There are a number of good restaurants in the Four Points Sheraton next door so there were lots of options. There is a massive mall about a block away that has other dining options as well.The only issue we ran into was a few taxi drivers refusing to take us to the Summer Palace because I guess they felt it wasn't far enough. The minimum rate is 10rmb. But the staff at the Four Points Sheraton (which is on a busier road than the side street for Aloft) were quite helpful in finding taxis for us if they weren't already there.We would definitely stay there again and recommend it to our friends for its excellent value.\"]\n",

Key points about this property:- its a starwood property, much cheaper than the rest, and it shows in the pretty incompetent reception staff, the hard bed, the cheap blinds that don't quite block out the sun in the mornings, and common areas which seem to be degrading very quickly (given how new this hotel is).- on the up side, it is very clean and tidy, and if that is important to you, this hotel presents good value. It is also quite stylishly designed and looks much more modern than anything else in this price range.- location is poor for the typical tourist. Yes, very poor. It is not really close to much cheaper the summer palace, and other places will require a taxi, which will probably result in hours of being frustratingly stuck in traffic. Taxi drivers also dont know where it is. If coming from the East, (i.e. city centre or airport) then it is the right turn AFTER the Four Points hotel, which is adjacent. If you are trying to scam an SPG platinum status in the cheapest way possible, perhaps stay in these two adjacent SPG hotels for 25 nights and check out every night.On the whole I thought it was decent value, but dollar for dollar, I would personally prefer to pay double for the Westin in Chaoyang or Financial Street. I have stayed at both at approx. double the price, for real 5 star service. But if thats not in your budget and you want the assurance of an international hotel chain, this hotel is perfect for you.Lastly, this hotel may also be appropriate for university students in Haidian, but don't pick this unless you know what you are doing. Taxis to BLCU or Tsing Hua may be exceptionally frustrating because of constant traffic around Zhong guan cun street. Tell taxi drivers to go on the four ring road, even though it might be a bit more expensive.There is free internet, but it does not seem to work with iPhones.\"]\n",

But if you don't mind taking the taxi to the closest subway station, which costs only 15-20 CNY a ride the hotel represents excellent value for money given its low prices and the modern, quiet and very clean rooms. Also internet use is for free. Especially for travellors who don't want to spend the money for a Hyatt or Hilton but who look for a very decent place to stay this hotel represents an excellent choice.\"]\n",

For those wanting a downtown location, this property may not be for you - I recommend factoring in taxi fares in and out of town when working out the value here. On the otherside, the rates for the hotel are very good and the rooms are basic but well appointed. TV was more focused on local channels which may be an indication of the clients they are targeting. There was however the standard HBO, BBC, etc. Staff were very friendly and check in and check out times were acceptable.']\n",

       "['regular room very bad breakfast food was scarce and rubber seemed good location and room for parking. NOT RECOMMEND',\n",
       " 'The truth is this hotel is great for people who just want a clean basic bed and bath. Furthermore, the staff we encountered was truly the best we have ever encountered (especially Raphael). Helpful &amp; kind, Rapheal went out of his way to make our stay comfortable and was great with tips about the area. However, it is a small hotel with small rooms; furthermore while it is in a perfect location in Montreal the street it is on is not the most picturesque.P.S . The chocolate croissants for breakfast were yummy.',\n",
       " 'We travel to Montral four times a year for vacation. This was the second time we stayed here and have made reservations for November/December. The price is great and includes parking and breakfast. The location is perfect for us, near the Berri/UQAM Metro. We use it or walk to the Downtown, Old Montral, Mont Royal or Village districts. It is also near the Library and Archives if you are doing genealogy research. Yes if you want a luxury hotel, look elsewhere. But if looking for a good location and a good price, this is a good choice.',\n",
       " \"Not a nightmare or anything, but definitely a cheap 2-star hotel.- Online photos are very deceptive. Rooms are small, simple, kind of boring.- Beds are terrible, really uncomfortable. No extra pillows.- Bathrooms: okay- It's on a busy street. If your room faces the street, drunks leaving the bars could wake you up.- There's air conditioning for the whole floor, but can't control the A/C in your room independently.If you're not picky and are the type of person that can fall asleep anywhere, you won't care. But if you're like me and you want a comfy bed and some real quiet, pay the extra 25/night for another hotel.\",\n",
       " \"I stayed at the Manoir Des Alpes for two nights with my partner. I thought it was perfect. The rooms have nice high ceilings and seem quite clean. The location is very good. right near the gay Village, but not noisy. It's also close to Old Montreal. The breakfast was very good too..cereal, bagels, toast etc. and is on offer until 11 a.m. So altogether a good experience, if you don't want luxury.\",\n",
       " \"The hotel has seen better days no question, but the rooms were clean, the breakfast was ample, and the price was right. From here you are walking distance to Old Montreal (10 minutes), Molson Stadium (30 minutes brisk pace), and when we went Just for Laughs was on. You're about 5 minutes away fro St. Denis St. which is where all that takes place. If you're looking to stay in the lap of luxury, go somewhere else. If you want somewhere to keep your bags and sleep, this is it. BTW water pressure is good and very hot so be careful.\",\n",
       " \"This hotel displays the 3 star plaque outside the front entrance, but in comparison to other hotels in Quebec, this rating is definitely a mistake. The room we had was very shabby, with crooked walls, haphazard construction, with a typical roadside hotel comforter and bathroom accessories. The staff was nice enough, and the breakfast was ok, but the overall design, feel and experience was definitely a 2 star hotel. I don't know if this deserves a 'value' rating here....you pay for what you get in this case.\",\n",
       " \"YOUR STUFF WILL GET STOLEN FROM THE PARKING LOT!!!! They smashed the window and took my stuff. I told the front desk clerk and he said &quot;Really? The clerk last night was supposed to check the parking lot every 20 minutes&quot;Well obviously, he didn't do his job!Asked him if the Hotel would cover my loss, he said that the hotel is not responsible for their own parking lot?This hotel makes you pay for everything when you CHECK IN, NOT when you check out.The room was small and you have to ask the front desk clerk to turn on the air conditioning, you can't control it from within the room. It is an old hotel, no computer, they use a log in book, no key cards, they usual actual keys. You can hear everything from your room, dim lighting, old crappy TV and obviously a BAD area since people break into people's cars. Small room, just terrible hotel!You get what you pay for. Do yourself a favour and pay an extra 20bucks per night for a hotel chain in downtown Montreal that provides SECURITY and good service.\",\n",
       " \"I stayed with my husband for 2 nights at this hotel. It is not a luxury hotel, but it is very clean, confortable and the staff is friendly. The guy at the front desk speaks English and helped us a lot with directions to the places I wanted to visit. Parking is free and so is breakfast. The breakfast is not huge; just an assortment of breads/bagels/croissants/muffins; cereal; orange juice and coffee. Don't be expecting to have omelettes, bacon and sausage because its just continental breakfast. Yes, they charge your card at time of check in, not at check out. I guess basically because since the parking and breakfast are free and the room doesn't have a mini bar nor they have room service, there is nothing else to charge other than the room. Location was fine because it has easy access to the different places we wanted to see. Its right on St. Catherine (they had an art exhibit on the street when we were there), walking distance to Old Montreal and they have a metro station steps away from the hotel.I would love to go back to Montreal. Would I go back there? yes, if I go back just with my husband. If I go back with my kids I would probably stay somewhere else only because the location although convenient, looks a little seedy to be walking around with children.So if you go with other adults, and want to save some money to spend it in the wide range of great restaurants and bars in Montreal you'll be fine staying here.Oh! I forgot to say the rooms have good Wi-Fi, and its also free.\",\n",
       " \"I'm not sure who wrote the prevous reviews, but my husband and I, along with 2 friends, booked 2 rooms at te Manoir des Alpes and we were sorely disappointed. I bookd the hotel based on the rave reviews in tripadvisor. However, I should have been warned when all of the reviews spoke of how &quot;clean&quot; the place is. Yes, it is clean, but it is far from 3-star quality. We got what was billed as a &quot;better&quot; room, with a queen bed (which really was a double bed), and a single bed. Half the room had hardwood floors and half the room had some sort off outdated tile. Our room opened to the outside alley via a big metal door. The bathroom,while clean, was from the 60s, and lighting in the room was dim, to say the least. I could go on, but suffice it to say that this is a budget hotel that deserves on star at most. The breakfast offered consists of coffee, tea, orange juice and some breads. We went out for breakfast after drinking some coffee. For those on a severe budget, this hotel is fine, as long as they don't expect 3-star quality.\",\n",
       " \"Not exactly what we had set our sights on, but the hotel and the staff turned out to be one of our best experiences in Montreal. It has a very friendly atmosphere, and you feel as though you've stepped back in time. Rooms are extremely clean and comfortable, with modern bathrooms. Most of all, we were amazed at the service we received. Definitely a place I would go back to.\",\n",
       " 'The staff was very helpful and accommodating. For example: I was not going to be able to make it to the Hotel by check-in time. I called them to let them know, and was told: &quot;no problem&quot;.The room I stayed in for 6 nights, was really nice. The different types of muffins they had were delicious. They were part of the choices, for their continental breakfast. I like the idea of free parking. The location is nice.',\n",
       " 'We booked 4 rooms in early April and had a great stay. The rooms varied in size but were very clean and the staff was excellent. Everyone we encountered over the 3 days were extremely helpful and friendly.Great value!',\n",
       " \"We stayed three nights for a weekend concert event at the L'Olympia theatre, which was within just a couple of blocks. Without exception, the staff was friendly and accommodating. The bedroom and bathroom were both immaculate, and during the chilly early spring season the room was cozy and warm. The side street the hotel is located on was quiet at night and we both slept very soundly. We would definitely visit again.\",\n",
       " 'Montreal is full of so-called &quot;small hotels&quot; which are kind of a cross between a regular hotel and a smaller bed and breakfast. They often provide a free breakfast and have personal service, but they are larger and the rooms are more like regular hotel rooms than foofy b&amp;b bedrooms. These are often mom and pop outfits and can be of varying quality. On a recent trip to Montreal, our stay at the Manoir des Alpes was well worth the price: a clean, quiet, moderately appointed room, continental breakfast with many varieties of baked goods, friendly courteous staff, and best of all, more than ample parking -- which is difficult to find at a moderate priced hotel in Montreal. The location is great, it was one block from the Olympiad, a theater on St. Catherine street. Old Montreal is a 10 minute walk, and the contemporary art museum, the Bay department store and many other local attractions are within walking distance. In addition, the hotel is a block from the Beri-Uqam subway stop making it very easy to get around the city from this terrific location. We were very happy with the price and accomodations and will make this our first choice when planning future trips to Montreal.',\n",
       " 'Great location. The staff was friendly, helpful and accommodating. Very quiet. I thoroughly enjoyed my stay and would recommend them. I will stay there again.',\n",
       " \"The only good thing I can say about this hotel is that it was very clean. It reminded me of the type of hotel you see on the TV that rents by the hour - very noisy at night with lots of people wandering around - need I say more?? Small rooms, very 70&quot;s in style and I would say it hasn't seen a coat of paint since the 70's either. It was quite seedy. A good central location but I would never go back there again or recomend it to anyone.\",\n",
       " 'We stayed at this hotel for 2 nights back in 2007 during an Easter Weekend. It was a last minute booking that I made over the phone directly with the hotel.I remember that compare with other hotels in the area this one was one of the few still available in our budget (about $100 per night).The room was clean, nothing fancy and met our expectations, since we were driving around Montreal and visiting places we just needed a place to sleep. The breakfast included was usual continental breakfast but it was all we needed.Parking was included as well, at the back of the building.As the person on the previous review said, if you avoid walking too far left on Rue St.Catherine as you come out of St. Andre from the hotel, you should be fine.',\n",
       " \"We had reservations (pun :-) against this hotel after we had booked. The rates (115$ incl taxes - Thanks giving weekend price) seemed a little outside our budget and we were concerned about getting a raw deal. Needless to say our expectations were low. We had drawn alternate plans, in case the room fell below our expectations. The room turned out to be just fine. We looked for cockraches (as some of the other reviews claimed, had found, but found none :-). The room was smallish, yet spacious for our needs. The furniture consisted of a writing desk and a wooden cabinet and cloth hanger. The breakfast is modest, nothing fancy. The staff was friendly and helpful. As you come out of St.Andre to the left there are some sex shops. That might be a consideration if you plan to do some walking with kids in the evenings. But if you avoid walking too far left on Rue St.Catherine as you come out of St. Andre from the hotel, you should be fine.  There are two big pluses to this place - (a). It's location, off Rue St. Catherine is close to both the old city and downtown. The subway (Berri UQAM) and bus station are right around the corner. (b). Free parking in the downtown area. We found later that the hotel is rated in the Official Montreal city guide as a '* * *'.\",\n",
       " \"This was my second stay at the hotel. It's a good value if you are driving to Montreal and do not want to be slave of your car after your arrival. I tend to leave my car and take metro at Berri-Uquam or walk. It is small, old school (room keys are actually keys, reservation book is actually a book), beds are hard (some people don't like that), not handicap accessible. There are a lot of homeless close to the hotel around the metro station, but not on the street of the hotel. I have stayed there total 7 nights in the past year and left/arrived that area on foot late in the night and didn't feel threatened. It is very clean for an old hotel and they provide continental breakfast. It's not the best but there is variety. They have supermarket waffles with fake syrup, muffins, Montreal bagels, croissant, cereal, whole and white bread (bagged supermarket variety) good coffee and OJ. If you just want to start your day but not a feast, that works for me. Both times I've stayed in the parking lot side, which was quiet. Corridor walls are not, so you do hear people coming late in to their rooms. Hot water pressure is good. Operable pane of the window was small so we used AC in the fan mode, otherwise small room tends to get stuffy. I would recommend this place if you want a clean bed to come to after a busy day in the city, where you know you can park your car and have free breakfast, all in budget. I would not recommend for people with kids, or romantic getaways.\",\n",
       " \"This hotel is extremely small and old. Furnishings are from the '70s and the place looks like it hasn't been renovated in decades. They made our reservation for the wrong week, then argued with us when we arrived (as if it were our fault). Noisy at night, and the breakfast was stale breads and instant coffee. Very disappointed, since we paid $120 for a room that was only worth, in our opinion, one star. The next night we stayed a few blocks away for $65 and got a large suite. I really wouldn't recommend this hotel to anyone, unless everything else is booked.\",\n",
       " \"I've stayed here several times before (last stay: November 2007) and, generally speaking, have always enjoyed it. However, this time, it seemed to me that owner and staff have reached what I would call the &quot;threshold of indifference.&quot; Perhaps it comes with being in the business for quite some time, as the owners of the Manoir have been. A modicum of welcome and no interest at all in whether I enjoyed my stay. Key left and that's that. A further irritation was the cigarette smoke -- though rooms are all supposed to be non-smoking. Though I complained about the smoke (which sat in my room until the open window finally cleared the smell in the small hours), I was given the impression that there was little interest in doing much about it. This trip a definite disappointment -- and I will certainly think twice about returning. A shame.\",\n",
       " \"Hi everyone!I have stayed at this hotel so many times, that I have lost count of the number of stays I've had here.The location is outstanding. It is in the heart of the gay village. One of the biggest problems I have is that because the price is reasonable, the rooms are clean, and the service is excellent, there tends to be a contingent of budget travelling families. (Not that there is anything wrong with that.) Some of these families tend to let the kids run wild in the halls, thus disturbing that much needed early evening disco nap that you (don't try to deny it!) and I need before going out to play for the evening.Gripe #2 in the same vein, is that you get a lot of youngish travellers who whoop it up pre and post party time. In fact, once, I don't think the party kids even made it out the door, and the jams that were going on when I left, were STILL going on when I came back at 5am. Christ in a Cab! I've stayed here 100's of times. I have never once seen a bug, and the rooms are scrubbed to spotless perfection each day. The staff is ALWAYS accommodating, friendly and polite. In fact, the owner pushed me out of a snow bank early one morning, when I was stuck! (I was in my car, goofy!)The continental breakfast is good enough if you are in a rush. I'm not a fan of hotel eats, take me someplace off the beaten track! Speaking of, there is a petit plethora of restaurants in the area (Mike's, St. Huber). Please don't disappoint me by eating at these places, when you are a just short trot away from places like Cora, Le Saloon, and Piccolo Diavolo. Ahem. Bottom line, a clean, convenient, decent place to stay for the single traveller who can deal with a few, generally noise related issues, and the traveller who doesn't require a chic, modern looking hotel.\",\n",
       " \"I just returned from a weekend trip to Montreal, and I have to say, this place is not what I expected...AT ALL. To be fair, let me first say that if you're looking for an extremely basic place to sleep for the night, want to be close to everything, are very tight on money, and don't care what type of environment you sleep in, then this might be the place for you.We (my hubby &amp; infant daughter) wanted a place that would be in the heart of everything, near the metro, have free parking &amp; breakfast, and have a good deal on the price. It had all of that, but I was very misled by the looks of their website, and unfortunately, some of the reviews here (then again, it could have been my perception).When we drove into the area, I thought to myself, &quot;Uh oh.&quot; I knew it was kind of a seedy area from the reviews, but it was way more so than I thought. I grew up in a city, but didn't expect the hotel to be in surroundings as such from their website. Although there were plenty of restaurants open at night nearby (St. Hubert, Mike's, etc.), the area was more of a college/20-something scene. If you've got little kids, be aware that there's a 'peep show' place right down the block.OK, I'm really not trying to make this review sound very negative, but as I was saying, I was misled by the website, which makes things look very inviting and spacious. When I walked in through the entrance, I was surprised by how cramped the place was. It smelled of cigarette smoke (one of the two owners was puffing away despite the &quot;thank you for not smoking&quot; sign less than 3 feet away from him). Their &quot;reservation system&quot; was a notebook and pen, and they gave me a photocopied slip of paper to put on our car's dashboard for identification purposes (there was no attendant from what I could see). They also billed my credit card as soon as we arrived, rather than when we checked-out.The owners were friendly, and initially gave us a room with a queen and a twin, thinking that we would put my daughter on it at some point. But the room was so dark, cramped, and cold (corner room with two windows, and an emergency door leading outside) , I initially thought we might have to find another place to spend the night. The bathroom was better than the room, but I still didn't feel comfortable having my litte one sleep somewhere where it was so cold. And it didn't help that it seemed like this was a place where some people spent the night for a &quot;quickie&quot;, if you know what I mean.I asked for another room, and he said he only had one other left. It was even tinier and more cramped than the first, but at least the feel of the room was a little better, and the lighting was brighter. To give you an idea of how cramped it was, you couldn't move around in the room unless you closed the door. My daughter didn't have anywhere to crawl around. I kind of felt like we were a family that just lost all their belongings and had to resort to desperate means for a night or two. Hubby was kind of mad, told me never to trust review ratings again, and to stick with trusted budget motel names. :(Before going, when I read all the reviews about the ample breakfast selections, I thought that would at least make me feel better the following day. Not so. It was a pretty basic continental breakfast: croissants, chocolate pastry, bagels, cereal, coffee, and hot chocolate. The owner brought me a glass of orange juice, but I didn't have the heart to tell him I have acid reflux and it wasn't good for me. :) Overall, I wouldn't stay here again, nor would I recommend anyone (other than the single, budget traveler) to stay here. I just didn't like the feel of the place, even though the owners were friendly, and did assist us when we needed help with finding a late-night delivery place. They're nice, but it's just that the place isn't so nice for a young family. Unfortunately, it totally ruined our trip.\",\n",
       " 'This hotel is a very cute place to stay. Well located, near the subway and bus terminal, easy to go walking to all the city, even to the Biodome and surroundings (which are far from the city, about 1 hour walking). Prices are very nice to Montreal hotels. Room is very comfortable, clean, cute, bathroom with whirlpooll, and hair drier. Breakfast is delicious, with muffins, croissants, waffles, milk, orange juice, butter, jam, chocolate cake....very good! Front desk staff is very polite and solicitous. I really recommend this hotel!',\n",
       " \"I don't do much traveling, but I do visit Montreal about twice a year and I always stay at this hotel. $85.00 a night, includes Parking! In many places you would pay almost that amount just for the parking. Make no mistake however you are not getting 4 Seasons luxury at these prices, but it is clean and comfortable and friendly and convenient. Located just off St. Catherine in the Gay Village. Nightlife, which is what I'm there for, is located right around the corner. Yet the area around the hotel is generally very quiet. It's true that Montreal has a serious pan handler problem, not just in this neighborhood, but they are considerably less aggressive than the pan handlers in San Francisco whom I did find to be truly obnoxious and aggressive. One recommendation I would make to the management. It would be great if you supplied &quot;Do Not Disturb&quot; signs that people could hang from their doorknobs. When I visit Montreal I frequently stay out all night and don't get to bed until after breakfast. Although I will usually ask the desk clerk to let housekeeping know that I don't want to be disturbed and they should skip my room I still often end up having to jump up from bed when they try to come into the room. I would sleep much better if I felt a little more secure about not being disturbed.\",\n",
       " \"Staff is friendly, rooms are smallish but spotless. Next time well pay the extra $10 for 2 beds, if only to get the bigger room. Plenty of free parking. Good breakkie and a lovely dining area. Free WiFi that works well. Short 10 min walk to both of our favorite places: Vieux Montreal and Rue St. Denis. Grocery and liquor stores 1 block away. Major subway hub is 3 min walk. Neighborhood is borderline sketchy but not bad. Gf was fine with it, and she's picky. Anyway, one block and you're into the good section. At $102 USD including tax on Labor Day weekend, very reasonable. We stayed 4 nights.The 2 very negative posts below, obviously penned by the same hand under different names, should be ignored. I would normally have preferred to keep this hotel a best kept secret, but decided to weigh-in to help set the record straight, out of fairness .Our must do's in Montreal: Jardin Nelson in Vieux Montreal (great setting, food and service).Eduardo's restaurant on St. Denis (Italian, cheap, delish, clientele largely local, byob).Botanical Garden.Little Italy. A &quot;steamy&quot; hot dog &quot;all dressed.&quot; Skippable: The smoked beef sambo at Schwartz's Deli (St. Laurent). We didn't like it. Most people disagree with us, so if it sounds like your style, fall in line and try one.\",\n",

The hotel is very convenient (free parking - there were still plenty of slots available when we arrived late Friday night/early Saturday morning at 1:30am) and easy to find. The rooms are clean, the staff are friendly and the breakfast is good. The only bad thing I have to say about this hotel is that the surrounding area is a little dodgy at night, but nothing that would turn me off going there again by any means. The location is really convenient, but if some beggars and late night revellers give you a fright then I wouldnt recommend it.',\n",
       " \"Not a bad stay, a pretty good value... especially the free parking. For some reason one night the hotel turned off the air conditioning just after midnight. A little annoying, but they turned it right back on when I called and asked about it. The biggest warning, however, is that this hotel is located very near a rather seedy area off St Catherine's. Since this was my first visit to Montreal, I wasn't sure about the specifics of that location... not really family friendly. Not unsafe mind you, just not what I expected. But if you know that going into it, and don't mind, then this place is a good find.\",\n",
       " \"My husband and I recently stayed here for two nights in August. The room was very basic but clean and the staff was very nice. The free parking is a great asset in Montreal- and part of the reason that I booked the room. The location is pretty central - but not in a very nice area of St. Catherine's. I was unpleasantly surprised by the number of strung-out beggars in the area- some who were rather aggressive. We always took a cab back to the hotel at night. I personally would not feel very comfortable walking this area at night- and I have lived in NYC and other urban areas. The hotel itself was fine- but the location left something to be desired.\",\n",
       " \"My husband and I stayed here almost a week and found it to be a good bargain in a very convenient location. We had reserved a room with a queen bed for a very reasonable price, but when we arrived we were given a room with only a double bed. This room was rather small and worn in places, but seemed clean and functional. The price was even cheaper than what we had originally reserved, so we stuck with the double bed since we would not spend that much time in the room anyway.As budget travelers, we did not expect or require many amenities, although we did notice that several items we typically saw in 3-star hotels were not available here (there was no safe, no alarm clock, no fridge). As others have mentioned, there is no elevator, but we had very few bags so it was not a problem even though we stayed on the third (and top) floor. The free breakfast -- in a charmingly set up area -- was quite filling, with many bagels, croissants, danishes and cereal to choose from (although my husband wished for one or two healthier options like fruit or yogurt). There was also free parking and free wireless internet, although we didn't make use of either. The staff was generally friendly and helpful.The hotel is a short walk from the central Berri-UQAM metro station, which provides access to 3 of Montreal's 4 subway lines. (We bought weekly metro passes, and staying at this hotel made transportation incredibly easy.) The hotel is also fairly close to rue St. Denis, which is filled with restaurants, and even the Old Montreal neighborhood is not far away (we walked there when we had the energy).Overall, we had a good experience, and the combination of price and location makes the hotel ideal for a budget-conscious traveler who does not want to stray too far from the city sights.\",\n",
       " \"My wife and I came here to visit Montreal and for the Police concert. We chose this hotel for its location and the value that it provided. Check in is at 1pm. Got free parking, which is a big plus Downtown Montreal. Outside blends in with the street architecture. Inside is clean. Staff is welcoming and friendly and can provide information upon request. There is no a/c in the hallways which makes it stuffy if hot outside. Inside the room a/c is very quiet and has multiple settings. The decor is a mixture of cottage, French and a bit of the 80s. Bathroom and room are clean, which is all you need when you're sightseeing in the city and don't get to your room until midnight. Rooms are not large by any means. Ours had a queen size bed. Very close to the Metro and St. Cathrines St, and walking distance to Old Montreal. If you are driving, you might want to bring your own pillow as these pillows are very soft, like pancakes. Also, the mattress is very soft, for those of us that appreciate a harder one. For those of us who want to spend our money in the city, this hotel will be good to your wallet.\",\n",

The room price was very cheap, the room was a good size, very clean and well kept, the free breakfast had a variety of pastries, bagels etc..., free parking was a bonus especially in Montreal and it's very close to Sainte Catherine street and a 5 minute walk from Old Montreal. We had a great time there, the staff was very friendly and accomodating, I would definitely recommend it and would stay there again!\",\n",

Rarely do good price, good location, great service, and pleasant atmosphere combine under one roof--and they've done it. We stayed there a whole eight months ago and still talk about how nice it was. The staff was friendly and cordial, and the manager was grandfather-esque. Bizarrely there were many oversized mirrors everywhere, including in our small (but cozy!) room, though you couldsay they only served to magnify the charm. As others have mentioned, the location, at the price you're paying, is pretty unbeatable--and for those with a car, the hotel has its own parking lot.

Anyway, the hotel is great, the management super-friendly and helpful and the rooms spotlessly clean. I've never seen such a clean bathroom. I really can't understand all these negative reviews. Our room was perfect for us with a queen bed in the main room and a twin in kind of an alcove. There was free wi-fi access and cable tv and everyone enjoyed the breakfast buffet, especially the Montreal bagels.

The room was small but meticulously clean and well organized. Lovely hardwood flooring in the room and great service. The breakfast in the morning is basic - pastries, croissants, coffee, juice so it 's good for a quick bite before hitting the road. Caveat - there is no elevator to the second floor so if you're older or have massive luggage it may not be the ideal choice. It is the absolute best for younger folks flying in for a weekend, or couples getting away. Can't beat the location to price ratio. It's literally several feet away from Rue St. Catherine where you want to start all your touring. Great place!\",\n",

It's perfectly clean and the old world decor is very charming. The staff was courteous and friendly and helpfully (for us) bilingual. I would stay here again in a heartbeat.\",\n",

It's right near UQAM (and just a few blocks from the Berri-UQAM metro stop), and only about a 15-20 minute walk to Old Montreal. It's off of St Catherine, which is THE spot for after hours clubs, but oddly you would never know it if you weren't planning to hit those joints. St Andre street is quiet, and we didn't hear a peep outside any night - got wonderful nights' sleep. The bed was comfortable, the room spacious enough (it's not the Ritz, after all), the room and bathroom very clean, and the staff friendly and helpful. You get a complimentary breakfast every AM (coffee, juice and muffins/cereal/croissants - nothing fancy, but as much as you want). This was a perfect home base if you're going up to check out the city. Note: the bath towels were a little flimsy and small (I use massive plush bath towels at home). Over all, I highly recommend if you don't have to be pampered and are looking for a good $$ deal.\",\n",

We gave it a try.To make things short, we enjoyed everything about our stay. We had a charming room with a queen and a single bed which is perfect for a couple and their child. The bathroom had a pretty nice size and was perfectly clean. The first thing we check in a room is the bathroom. You can say a lot about an establishement by looking at the bathroom and let me tell you that there was nothing bad to say about it. You could clearly see the cleaning lady took her work seriously. You fully deserved the tip we gave you... We also had one of those expensive quiet air-conditionning units on the wall, it was a welcomed addition. The parking was BIG. They have more space then they need, I couldn't beleive it. The breakfast was enjoyable, they have lots of choices so you can always pick-up something different every morning. My kid was always after those chocolate muffins.Did I mention that all of those are included in the rate they give you? I talked to the receptionist and he told me that they had budget, standard and deluxe rooms to choose from. So wether you're on a budget or not you'll always find something.I'll be coming back for sure. They told me the Just for Laughs festival is a couple of corners away. I think it will be worth it.\",\n",

       " \"I wanted to visit montreal with my wife in the beginning of January. The name of the place did catch my attention so I went on their website. It was a bit dated but I was able to easily make the reservation by e-mail. I went there by car and was a bit nervous when I saw that parking in downtown was almost non existent even for that time of year. How relieved was I when I got to the hotel and saw their parking. I mean, it is HUGE! They could probably build another hotel in there. Now on to the hotel itself. Well let me tell you, this place is absolutely charming. I was a bit worried because the rate they gave me seemed a bit low for a 3 stars hotel but I figured we were in the low season. I had nothing to worry about: the room was perfect! Nice queen size bed, nice bathroom and most of all, it's very clean. There's nothing like entering a hotel room and feel it has never been used before. It shows the respect the establishement has for its guests.I had a nice chat with the night receptionist while having a tea in the breakfast room. He told me they had deluxe, standard and budget rooms. I was in a standard room but for just $10 CAD more I could get an even more spacious room.The breakfast was a nice surprise too. Croissant, chocolate breads, bagels, cheese... it's only a fraction of what they offer and best of all, it's all you can eat! The breakfast room is a nice open area where you can have conversations with other friendly tourits (we met a nice couple from Vancouver).Overall I would recommend Hotel Manoir des Alpes to anybody who wants a satisfying and quiet stay. They recently installed wireless high speed internet so next time I go there, i'll bring my laptop.\",\n",
       " \"We stayed there on a free Priority Club night and it was terrible! I booked it, rather than the downtown location, because I was able to book a club floor which also has access to a lounge. We checked in only a little bit early, and since our room wasn't ready, they decided to gave us a different room - on the 17th floor (Wish I had said I'd wait for ours, and found out what the original room would have been like). There is no way it was recently renovated. It had very tired looking furniture and peeling wallpaper. This room was like a cheap university residence room-- and the bed had a very hard, old, thin, cheap mattress. Nothing was mentioned about the so-called &quot;benefits&quot; of a club floor when I checked in except that she confirmed it would be quiet because it was a club floor. It was the worst night I've ever spent in a hotel. If this floor is quiet, what are the rest like? The windows don't muffle the traffic noise./sirens. You can hear every toilet around you flushing and every door slamming when people come in for the night - I didn't sleep until 3:45 am! In the morning, I called to ask where the lounge was, and was told that there would be coffee, pastry, and fruit...we went up at about 8:30 am and there was nothing there besides a coffee machine! We bought breakfast in the restaurant on the main floor, which was the only good thing about this hotel. Believe the other reviewers when they say it's noisy - even if you are a sound sleeper, you'll regret booking it! Save yourself from a bad night - book something else! Did I get a bad room because it was a free night? I've got to wonder....\",\n",
       " \"My husband and I, and two friends, spent 2 nights here a couple of days ago. The location is in a busy spot, right near McGill University, and walking distance from the Musee de Beaux Arts. The parking is rather expensive, at $19.95 per night, but we had to park the car somewhere, so we went for it. Our room rate was a reasonable $106 plus taxes for Friday, and it went up to $111 on Saturday, for some reason. We got a free upgrade to a controlled-access 18th floor room and that was a good thing. It was very quiet up there. Our friends were down on the 7th with mobs of high school kids on sports teams, bands, and fashion shows, and got no sleep whatsoever. This place seems to be the hotel of choice for low-budget groups. Anyway, our friends were woken up all night long by a big party across the hall. Finally the police came at 4:00 a.m. and broke it up.  The evening Concierge, Alex, was really helpful in pointing us towards the many bookstores in walking distance. He called ahead for closing times and saved us a lot of shoe leather.  Our room was large, and had a good city view. The floors and walls were not scrupulously clean, and the amenities were somewhat meager. For example, no tea, and not enough coffee nor cups. The bedding was very comfortable- duvet and padded mattress topper, and lots of pillows. There was only one desk chair, and a table with no chairs at all. We had free high speed wifi, which was a real plus. The room lighting was too dim, and not in the right places, so while I appreciated the free newspaper, it was too dark and uncomfortable to read it at night on the sofa. We received a voucher for free continental breakfast in the first floor restaurant, The waitstaff was very friendly and helpful, and the food was fine but not too plentiful. It might have been better to seek breakfast at the nearby Tim Horton's. This hotel was OK for the money, but next time we are here we'll probably look elsewhere.\",\n",
       " \"I just stayed at the Holiday Inn Montreal Midtown and I wasn't at all impressed. I booked through Hotwire, and our rate was good, but Hotwire classifies this hotel as 3.5 stars - and it doesn't meet that expectation in my opinion. Hotwire doesn't tell you where you are staying until you've booked - and when I found out I was staying at the Holiday Inn I wasn't sure what to expect - but considering they rated this hotel as a 3.5 star property, I figured it would be more than adequate for service and amenities. The lobby was nice, and the room was large and decent enough, but the noise filtering through from the hallway was the worst I've experienced in a hotel. You could hear the guests in the room below us every time they flushed their toilet. In room amenities consisted of one tiny bar of soap and a tiny bottle of shampoo. There wasn't even a hotel directory in the room. There was hair in our sheets, and my spouse cut his finger on a small piece of glass embedded in the bed cover. The parking situation was terrible. Being Halloween, we didn't want to park our vehicle on the street, so we used the hotel's parking facilities. Valet parking is mandatory at this hotel, which we weren't happy about, considering the risk of damages and us not having easy access to our vehicle. In the evening we had dinner reservations outside the hotel, and waited 25 minutes for valet to bring us our truck as the attendant was too busy parking cars for a wedding party that had arrived - it appeared we were at the bottom of the priority list. And we had tipped them well beforehand! The doorman wouldn't call down to find out what was causing the delay - he simply passed the phone over to us and had us call down to valet to inquire. Needless to say we were late for our reservation and were rather frustrated. In the morning the express check-out service was not working, so I had to stand in line at the front desk for what seemed like forever - since there was only one staff member working on a Sunday morning. I've stayed at the Delta Montreal next door a number of times and found it to be a much better hotel all around, for the same price. I wouldn't go back to the Holiday Inn Midtown if I could avoid it...I suspect this hotel is being managed by bean counters trying to cut costs in every possible way.\",\n",
       " \"I actually have one night to go and writing a review before I leave. For those who know me, you know that the most important thing for me in a hotel other than location is the 'sleepability' of the hotel. Meaning, I don't care if the carpet is stained as long as I can sleep here and be comfortable. That being said, I have to start off with the worst thing about this hotel: the noise. As I lay in bed, I can hear the occupants on either side of me. I also hear the toilet's flushing, and as brash as it sounds, I can also hear people urinating into said toilets. It seems that the walls are made of a very thin material. In addition, one night I went to bed a bit earlier and heard vacumming at around 10pm which emulated a bizarre buzzing sound into my room. I also wonder what others could hear coming from my room. One morning I even tip toed around as I was up very early and didnt want to disturb my neighbours - how bizarre is that ? :)Therefore, I cannot recommend this hotel and would not stay here again. Sleep is very important to me, and on numerous occasions I would awake to a flushing toilet or someone coughing. One more thing, and this may also sound bizarre of me to say, but I think that room service is a little too punctual. Since I was here on leisure, I would sleep in until 9am and leisurely start my morning and had room service knocking on my door at 9:30am the first morning. Because of that, I used the 'do not disturb' sign every day until I was ready to leave the room. I've never really had to do that before until this hotel.Gee, this complaining stuff doesn't really sound like me, so below are some pros for the optimist in me!Some pros:location is good - close to downtown, metro, train station. lobby - has a coffee shop and a bar/restaurant if that is important to you wi-fi - works well here and easy to set up\",\n",
       " \"My stay at the hotel was much better than I expected. The room was very nice and clean. The lobby contained a restaurant and a cafe which was nice for early mornings. The only problem is that the rooms aren't as sound proof as I would've liked but other wise, great cheap stay.\",\n",
       " \"I usually stay at theHilton Garden Inn in Montreal but i saw the hotel last time i stayed in Montreal my wife and I decided to try to something new since the Hitlon is over price and the service is crappy....The Holiday Inn Midtown was such a delite from the way the staff is so polite and friendly....They upgraded me to their excutive levels we had a beautifull view of the city .... The swimming Pool is so huge for a hotel pool we where in shock.This is not your typical Holiday Inn , I am inquiring on how i would be able to change my points from Hitlon Honors, To this Priority card system that they are talking about.....I even saw staff from other Hotels with their name badge coming to their restaurent to eat...I can't wait to come back for New Year's......\",\n",
       " 'This hotel seems to save as much as possible. The free coffee maker in the room only offers two coffee bags and no tea at all. I called the reception and they said tea is only available upon request. The &quot;free newspaper&quot; (Priority Club) is not delivered but has to be picked up from the reception desk. A coupon for a free drink means that you have to buy one and the second is then free... Bathroom on the 18th floor (Executive) was in poor condition (tiles, etc), bathroom ameneties were minimal (less than in some Holiday Inn Express places). It looks like the hotel aims at serving large groups with bulk sales and has given up the idea of attracting individual travellers. I travel a lot and use Holiday Inns at a level authorizing their platinum card, but there seem to have been too many bad experiences with Holiday Inns of late. Is the chain repositioning itself for a lower end market?',\n",
       " \"My friends and I have chosen this hotel mostly for the price and were not expecting anything special. Actually, we were amazed by the good service that we received, especially at the front desk. The lady who registered us was nice enough to give us a nice room on the upper floor (corporate floor as they name it) without charging us for the upgrade. It started well. The room itself is cozy and we had a nice view of the Mont-Royal. We liked the express check-out, didn't have to pass by the front desk.Nice week-end overall and we can't wait to book another trip to Mtl and stay at the Holiday Inn!\",\n",
       " \"The Holiday inn midtown is one of the best holiday inn's i have stayed in. The lobby is very nice and the valet parking and concierge are very friendly and helpful. There are a couple of rude receptionists but the majority of them are helpful and friendly. One receptionist in particular was very rude. The entrance to the hotel is very nice and makes you feel like you are in a more expensive hotel than you actually are. We booked through hotwire and got an extremely good rate for the 3 nights. Especially when we had just spent double the price on an awful hotel in toronto! We were touring around eastern canada and montreal was our favourite part. The hotel is in a great location and a 20 minute walk took you to old montreal with the ports and some classic dining. The hotel is about a 5 minute walk from st laurence boulevard which has many beautiful restaurants and bars, i would recommend going there one night for a nice meal. We only used the metro once in our whole stay and that was just to find the best part of the underground city (mcgill).The rooms were bright and clean with a full length window giving great views of the city. Unfortunately the pool was closed for 3 days when we were there but the gym is well equipped. We didnt arrive in montreal until 8pm so having the restaurant and bar right in the lobby was perfect for us. They serve good food and the bar is very nice.Overall i would recommend this hotel to anybody, especially if you get a good rate on it! You can however hear every flushing toilet on your corridor!\",\n",
       " \"After reading some of the reviews of the other guests, I was a little skeptical. I was expecting an old and dirty hotel... Thankfully that wasn't so, we drove into Montreal from Burlington, VT. Took about a 90 minute drive.... but we got to Montreal and hotel around 11:00 AM. They had a room available at that time. They checked us into Room 712. Right next to the elevator. We were worried that it would be too noisy, but it was fine. The showers were a little old. There were cracks in the wall and some mold on the grout, but if you weren't looking, you would be fine. We checked for bed bugs.... Thankfully, the beds were clean. As were the towels and linens. I felt comfortable sleeping. The location of this hotel is great. Within a block or two of the McGill Metro stop. Four blocks up from the Place des Arts and within walking distance of old montreal and Mont-Royal. The only complaint that I had was the front desk staff. They were un-friendly and not really helpful. You would be standing in front of the receptionist, with no one else around but you and it took her several minutes to acknowledge you. Most of the staff did not smile. There was never a concierge on site, but if you were to go to the receptionist for a recommendation for a dinner restaurant, all they could do was refer to the concierge, but the concierge would never show up. Upon check out, we valeted our car... our ticket was in our suitcase, so we needed to put our suitcase on the ground to dig for it, only to have the valet service say rudely.. go to P2.... If you don't like people ...maybe you really shouldn't be in the industry.I'd recommend staying here, only be prepared for no service.\",\n",
       " \"We received a 20% discount through an online booking system and received a decent price during Labor Day weekend. The location is good - near McGill University and St. Laurent restaurants/bars but about a 15-20 minute walk to Old Montreal. They gave us a top room on the 17th floor with a king size bed and a spectacular view. On the surface the hotel looks quite good - the lobby is nice as well as the decor. But the hotel is a bit old and has some structural issues. You can hear every sound in the hallways and upstairs, particularly slamming doors. Also, the shower tiles had some mildew and the curtain smelled moldy. The shower water temperature also vascillated between super-hot to super-cold and back again - all within a few seconds. Overall, I'd say this hotel is worth a stay if you receive a discounted price and are on a budget. But if you are looking for a more luxurious hotel, I'd spend a bit extra and try one of the other modern brands.\",\n",
       " \"We had a room on the 4th floor. Around 4am my husband wakes me up telling me he was itching all over his body. We open the lights, remove the sheets and noticed little blood stains on the mattress. My husband and I then switched beds. I put the big cover on the bed and slept on top. Suddenly I feel something crawling on my face. I open the lights and there they were....BED BUGS ! Called downstairs. They sent someone and she asked me to help her remove the mattress (I'm 70 !) to look at the headboard ( funny, she knew exactly were to look!) then I was asked if I had a sample of the ''bug''..... AS IF ! We were switched rooms the next day. What a discusting hotel and what bad service.\",\n",

I didn't spend a lot of time in my hotel room, so it definitely served it's purpose- it was a place I could return to after a long day of sightseeing for some good night's sleep in a cozy, clean bed :) I also had dinner with my mom at the restaurant in the lobby- great soups and good service.\",\n",

       " \"The hotel itself is ok, However, the restaurant A &amp; G in the lobby which serves breakfast is a disgrace to the hotel and to Montreal scene. I've stayed in many hotels in downtown Mtl and never had I experienced such terrible, terrible food. Bad, awful, tasteless, foul coffee - horrible baked goods . Breakfast is a big disappointment, basically one should expect only a muffin, a yogurt and (did I mention) bad coffee. This is unacceptable in a city known for its gastronomy. First, it's not a buffet but an &quot; la carte&quot; breakfast with about 5 items (bagel, muffin, yogurt, danish, fruits) of which you chose 2 . At 9 am we were told that they had already ran out of 2 items. I can't believe that the waiter made a point in mentioning that our coupons covered only the breakfast, not the service (meaning &quot;tips&quot;). I don't know if he noticed that we hardly touched our breakfast. I suggest that you pay for breakfast at the other small independently-run, coffee place in the lobby.  Also, Holiday Inn Select in Chinatown, which is only a few blocks away had a very good breakfast buffet and their rooms are about the same prices. For anybody, specially families, I recommend Le Gouverneur, not very far either. Awesome buffet breakfast with fine bakeries, lots of fruits and even more, including wonderful coffee.\",\n",
       " 'Stayed here one Sunday night, as we couldnt extend our stay at another downtown hotel. Paid 110CAD for the night, plus about 25 for parking. Great price - parking was steep, though. Lobby very trendy, and not what youd expect for a Holiday Inn! Room was very comfortable - only complaint was cigarette burn mark on bed spread, and the light switches were all extremely low. I enjoyed staying here more than the two previous nights at Marriott Chateau Champlain.',\n",
       " \"OK, some nice things. Great Downtown location on Sherbrooke West. Crisp, clean towels and bedsheets. BUT - all else was horror!!!Our travel agent booked us two nights at the HIMM as part of a two-week tour itinerary of eastern Canada. After a week travelling independently in the rural wilds of east Quebec staying in low-budget motels, we were excited about our final two nights in a big-name hotel. How wrong we were. This is a fur coat, no knickers hotel if ever there was one: hi-gloss lobby, shocking rooms.We were allocated Room 228. Among its many delights were: crumbs from previous occupants on table, sticky spots on the floor tiles, grubby carpet, low-power shower that swerved from scalding to icy, long black hairs in the bath, nasty unidentified stains on the wall next to the toilet, a toilet that required you to lean your full body weight on the lever to flush, chipped washbasin, dirt-encrusted hairdryer, stained carpet, chipped veneer on the furniture, curtains broken free from their track that not only didn't close properly but had large horizontal tears (to get a full night's sleep, we had to secure the gaps with the tent-pegs - lucky we packed them, no?) I could go on and on and on, but you get the picture....Sadly, the horror doesn't end there. No sirree. As we checked in, a gang of school children burst screaming and yelling through the lobby. I turned to the receptionist and said - jokingly - 'we aren't on the same corridor, are we?' No of course not, said the receptionist without blinking. Guess what........?First thing we knew about it was returning from dinner, emerging from the lift to be confronted with two security guards. Our corridor was full of screaming boys, their teachers trying to herd them into rooms. I went straight downstairs and asked reception very politely if they could move us immediately. Receptionist - sneery - said that the hotel was very full and that there were only five unoccupied rooms. I smiled and said that any one of those five rooms that wasn't on a floor with the school party would do us just fine. Receptionist - glacial - said we could take that up with the hotel manager in the morning. Oh what fun we had! It took the teachers from 2200-2300 to round up the little darlings, secure them in their rooms and do a door-by-door final check. And then the routine started up next morning, from 0715-0800, this time accompanied by running down the corridors yelling and banging on doors. My partner bribed me with promise of a blow-out final dinner not to waste our last full day in Canada faffing around changing hotel rooms (assuming that the manager would have oh-so-generously allowed it). Instead, we made a point of staying away from the hotel for as much of the day as possible and not spending a cent on any of its additional facilities.I travel on business in the Middle East and some of my favourite properties are Holiday Inns. No Holiday Inn in that developing region would offer such shabby facilities or be so dismissive of a guest's complaints. I used to be a huge fan of the Holiday Inn brand. Not any more. AVOID HOLIDAY INN MONTREAL MIDTOWN LIKE THE PLAGUE.\",\n",

The hotel is located in a decent neighborhood next to Hilton and other 4-star hotels. There is a swimming pool and gym and free internet in the hotel.

The floor was quiet and the ice machine close and bed very comfy. Glad that the wifi was free. The hotel location is really good. But, take note, I would not pay full price for one of these 'upgraded' rooms that include the breakfast - as the breakfast quality was really bad - even when given for free, we didn't end up using the option after our first two experiences - the coffee was foul (made better in the in-room coffee maker), the &quot;orange juice&quot; was mostly water, and the baked goods were of poor quality. The room cleanliness was not great. The doors near handles don't look like they have been cleaned in months, I doubt the quality of vacuuming. The other thing is that for a hotel that seems to get a vast majority of its business from tour buses, they should set their elevators so that more than one works at a time. I guess it is possible that they give the more rundown rooms to the sale price customers - but still, it isn't a great way to show quality. If you get a good sale price then yes, this is an okay location - don't pay full price.\",\n",

I said give me a discount because I paid good money for a personal shower, and they said no way.The hotel room was clean and descent, but the bed I saw was really old and crappy looking.I would never stay here again because of the service, but for a budget traveller then okay, but if you can afford $150, stay elsewhere in Montreal.',\n",
       " \"We stayed there for three nights May 29 - June 2, 2008 and it's still being renovated. The lobby is mostly finished with a rather nice dark paneled wood and decent lounge area. The concierge was borderline rude but not to the point of ruining the stay, and the rooms were very decent. They were clean, rather basic, with two large beds with a red bedspread, a small table and lamp, the dresser with a TV on top, very standard for a Holiday Inn and similar chains. The bathroom could have used a reno with the tub being stained and water pressure being moderate, but it was not awful by any stretch. The vanity area needs better lighting as fluorescent lamps remind one of prisons and hospitals and make everyone look corpselike. There was an iron provided and a weak hairdryer. The restaurant was quite decent, the food was well prepared, simple and very reasonably priced. The location can't be beat, so if you don't rely on your hotel for much more than sleep, then it's not a bad place to tour Montreal from. You can walk to old Montreal AND Schwart'z, and the shopping on rue St. Catherine, so for us it was a pretty decent stay.\",\n",
       " \"Having had a disasterous stay in Holiday Inn on King, Toronto, this hotel was definitely a lot friendlier and had a good buzz about it. The restaurant was very good, having tried it for breakfast, lunch and dinner. The location is also very good. However, the rooms leave a lot to be desired. You couldn't swing a cat in the bathroom and the bathroom in our room had a big hole in the ceiling. There were renovations taking place at the time so the ceilings were down on our floor (can't remember whether it was the 9th or 10th floor) and looked unsightly.\",\n",
       " \"We spent 3 nights at the Holiday Inn Midtown over Memorial Day weekend. The hotel was very conveniently located and we got a terrific price($61 a night plus taxes and fees plus $18.50 a night for parking) on Priceline. We are Priority club members so our room was on the Concierge floor and a continental breakfast was included. It's hard to beat that value. The hotel is being renovated so the lobby and entrance are a mess. The room was a decent size with a small bathroom. The people at the front desk were very nice at check-in. The concierges were fairly incompetent - they could not give decent directions to anywhere. However, we managed to find our way around and had a terrific mini-vacation at a terrific price.\",\n",
       " \"We arrived at the holiday inn after our b&amp;b had cancelled our reservation for our night in Montreal.We arrived around 7pm and were pleasantly greeted by the valet people and the front desk staff. They were renovating the lobby area so it was a bit hard to find the entrance, but the staff helped us out wonderfully.After checking in with the more than professional and friendly check in staff we went up to our room on the 16th floor and enjoyed the view and the comfort of this clean, well equiped and comfortable room.We received vouchers for complimentary wine (buy one get one for free) or beer in the hotel bar, so before heading out for dinner we decided to take our apritif in the hotel lobby. The service was friendly and professional.We found our experience at this Holiday Inn very enjoyable and comfortable. We'll stay here again on our next trip to Montreal. (one day in Montreal is not enough)\",\n",

The rooms, however, were very comfortable, aside from the small bathroom. **All the rooms ajoined**If you can, park your car elsewhere because the Valet was overpriced, even with in/out privileges and they were also incompetant. It took FAR TOO LONG to get the vehicles in and out.Nice restaurant for breakfast or lunch.

The hallways and the actual suites stink of smoke. It's near the university, so the party never stops. This isn't a good thing though. At three in the morning on a random weekend (not reading week or anything) there were drunken kids running up and down the hallways banging on doors, squealing, and screeching. We told the front desk and they sent someone up to clear the halls and not more than 15 minutes later the kids were baaack. Don't go unless you are one of those kids.\",\n",

Walking distance to great restaurants and shopping.The hotel room I had was very comfortable and roomy. For a two week stay, I appreciated the small laundry facility and the very small gym. I had issues with noise though. I could hear someone across the hall coughing and sneezing all night. I could here my next door neighbor talking on the phone. One afternoon, during renovations, the contractor was drying paint on the ceiling with a hair dryer. I can here the water pipes.The hotel is mediocre but I wouldn't book there unless it is significantly cheaper than all the surrounding hotels of similar star ratings.\",\n",
       " 'Okay, we dont expect the best experience at holiday inns, and they can be somehow depressing, but functional. At this holiday inn which had a fairly good location, the staff was unhelpful and rude, and the rooms on one side were so loud, that it was like being inside an airplane engine. Since this was a business room, I had access to the lounge with complementary continental breakfast: 3 muffins which were gone by 7 AM and coffee from a machine in a tiny room with one sofa and one internet access. Any attempt to get any help for a room change was meet with complete unhelpfulness. In fact, the reception staff seemed poorly trained. The concierge desk was, however, helpful and better prepared. The overall attitude of the place seemed to be that if you could only afford to stay at this hotel, then what did you expect? So make your choice.p.m. from Munich',\n",
       " \"My stay in Holiday Inn Montreal was for 2 days but I could experience some good stuff and some bad too. Starting with the rooms, they seemed to be very simple, confortable beds (at least when I was there), TV... but about the bathroom, it was so small that you have to be skilled to put on your clothes... claustrophobic for most people...About the lobby, no big hassle to check in, and there's a small shop where you can buy some last-minute gift from Montreal if you are in a hurry.The soda machines were broken and there was not any warning about that, therefore I had lost some coins but the staff gave me them back.Just stay there if you just want a 2 to 3-days stay and need somewhere to rest for a cheaper price. If you are coming with your family in vacations, I would not recommend it.\",\n",

Toiletries were provided daily and the room's linen were always freshly cleaned &amp; aired.The dining area was very appealing &amp; they have an ample choice of food choices/menus around the clock.The service was always prompt &amp; there was always ample staff members around should you require any assistance.I would have no hesitation in coming back to this hotel when I am next in Montreal\",\n",

The rooms are on the small side, with claustriphobic motel style bathroom, where the sink is outside of the bathroom. Beds are comfy, with good pillows (choice of four style, upon request).The gym and pool are decent, but they should really get rid of the ghetto grafitti design.The resaurant is a plus, with good prices, and decent selection. Breakfast was 8$CAN and was copious.Would go back only through priceline/hotwire.',\n",
       " \"We stayed here for a short stopover on our way from London to family and found the staff extremely welcoming, both in the hotel and the bar and restaurant. My husband I were travelling with our two 11 year old children and everyone could not have been friendlier. The rooms had recently been refrubished (we were the first guests in our room) and were pleasant enough although the bathrooms were very dated. As some reviewer commented the decor is very 80's but it is smart, clean, very comfortable and friendly.It is also reasonably central; a pleasant walk to the old town or the main shopping area. One of our main considerations was the cost - this was greatly cheaper than the other hotels in the same area.While I would have loved to stay in some of the swankier places the prices were far too high. On balance this was a good choice of hotel for us, definately value for money.\",\n",
       " \"I've stayed in this hotel for 2 weeks. it is a terrible experience. they couldn't care less about their guests. They are careless, dirty and the cleaning is just a bad joke. also, you should definitely try out their continental breakfast. It's a bad joke. i wouldn't recommend it to my worst enemy. they would not provide adapters for electricity, they make you buy one from their store even though as soon as you leave Canada you won't need it anymore. On one day they made me wait half an hour saying I hadn't pay the bill, when in fact they just cancelled my card room and never checked the bill. They did not even apologise.\",\n",
       " \"I stayed on the 15th floor and elevator will take you there only when you swipe your room card and you need to swipe it dozen times. Needless to say, it was very annoying. Hotel is going through renovation, but cleaning staff needs to do more cleaning. I was first put in the room on 9th floor, but it was obvious that it wasn't vacuumed and I saw hair in the bathroom, right next to the sink. I asked for a different room and was given room on the 15th floor, which was much better. The only plus is front desk who was more than pleasant and very professional. Very 80's style hotel, but my stay was ok, since I was there only to sleep. Hopefully, it will get better with renovations.\",\n",
       " \"We arrived to find we were given a room on the 9th floor with a lovely view of the building site and crane next door. We asked to move and were then moved to 10th floor at the front of the hotel with views towards mount royal. It stated on the booking forms that there would be a safe and a minibar neither of these were in our room, we asked at reception only to be told some rooms on the 10th floor do have them and some don't.The room was desperate for refurbishment, which was taking place in the hotel. The bed was very confortable however the bathroom was horrid, it had mould and mildew on the bath tiles. The pool was cold and very dated, the gym seemed well equipped. The laundary faclities were good.The best thing about this hotel was the restaurant, the breakfast were fantastic and really cheap and had a great choice. Would stay here again if only for the breakfast.Overall there was very little to do in Montreal but i'm pleased i've been.\",\n",

It's about 15-20 minutes walk from downtown, a little bit creepy if you're walking back to the hotel on your own at night, but it's located close to an underground station and it is possible to navigate from the hotel to the centre almost entirely underground!The hotel itself is quite basic, a little bit grotty, but was satisfactory for my needs (I wasn't really in the hotel for much of the time).\",\n",
       " \"We stayed at the HI Midtown for Grand Prix last weekend for three nights and had a very pleasant experience. While its true they were undergoing renovation, this did not affect us at all and there was no actual work going on while we were there. Most importantly, the hotel was extremely well located, just a block from the metro, and walking distance to everything from Old Montreal to the Crescent Street Grand Prix fair, Chinatown, the major Shopping centers and more. We left our car in the garage and didnt need to see it again until we checked out. As for the hotel itself, the lobby is very pleasant and modern. The room we stayed in was a corporate king which was newly renovated. Rooms are smaller than US standard hotel rooms but perfectly spacious for 2 people with a king size bed, a lounge chair, ottoman and desk. Bathrooms are a bit on the small side and not updated but clean and functional. We went into our friends room which was supposedly not yet fully renovated but the only difference was the furniture had not been updated yet. The concierge was very helpful in finding excellent places for dinner and in directing us to anywhere we wanted to go. The staff was very pleasant and helpful as well (we couldnt figure the safe out and someone from security came up in a matter of minutes to help.) This hotel is right next door to the Sheraton Four Points, the Marriott Courtyard and the Delta. I would say its the best of the 4. Don't be fooled by the name, HI did a great job keeping a very picky traveler happy. And the crepe shop around the corner on Breury is a perfect place for breakfast or a snack.\",\n",

Durning my last stay in a corporate floor room, the carpets in the halls were worn and patched. The room was satisfactory however the thermostat did not work; the tub had mildew around it; the tub drain did not drain properly leaving showering persons standing ankle deep in water during their showers; the double lock did not work and the bed was lumpy. As far as facilities the pool area was dark and poorly lit; the whirlpool was inoperable; the deck chairs all broken! Swimming in the pool was not pleasant. Their gym apparatus was fine and they do offer massages. I would recommend not staying here until their renovations are completed.\",\n",

       " \"How can you put down the Holiday Inn so much being an employee ...you say it should not be called a holiday...why? Is it because you being an employee you expect to get the pent house or ''royal'' service? When you're receiving an employee rate. Which is almost like you're paying nothing. Just to inform you of what the hotel is really like; a muticultural staff, who all speak at least 2 languages and more, a warm and positive atmosphere, an exciting place to be in one of the most beautiful cities of the world! So stop spending your vacations indoors and enjoy all the beauty Montreal has to offer!!!\",\n",

The floor to ceiling mirror was broken, they taped cardboard with duct tape around it. I had a problem wit the toilet, and the maintenance man was here in 5 mins to fix it. The valet parking is sub-par, most days you have to wait awhile, as they only seem to have 1 person working. However, the service is impeccable! Very friendly staff, super quick to respond to ANY problem. Convienient location to shopping and food. All in all it is a great deal if you want to save money. It is by far less expensive to the courtyard(next door). They have all the services you will need (money exchange, info desk, taxi, gift shop, bar/restaurant etc). The ATM does not take the plus network cards, but there is a Bank of Montreal ATM 1 block away. Not elegant for a luxury vacation, but great for the business traveller.',\n",

There is a small ven under the window and on hot days it does not cool the small room. Don't even think of closing the drapes because the air conditioning will just blow into the drapes and make them cold.The restaurant does not follow any standards of Holiday Inn.

I got a fairly negative impression from some of the other reviews on here, but the hotel didn't end up being that bad. Yes, there are tons of kids there. I suspect that many of them are 18- to 20-year-old Americans who can drink in Canada but not in the US. To get around this, you can request one of the private floors towards the top of the hotel. I stayed on one of these floors and had no noise problem the whole time I was there. The rooms are not the most modern, but everything in the room worked.The hotel had two very strong points: free, wired internet in all the rooms, and a good restaurant with reasonable prices. You can rent ethernet cables from the front desk for a $25, refundable deposit. I found the restaurants around the hotel to be on the expensive side, but the restaurant at the hotel was pretty good for pretty cheap.\",\n",

They did not speak very good english and I do not know any french which caused a very long time for me to check in , I waited for almost an hour. On the other hand the hotel's restaurant is very good and has a nice bar. It is also very close to all the nightlife and shopping.Warning! when I stayed there , their was so many high school and college students all over the hotel. At night they are all loud and drunk. At one point I was sleeping and I was awakened by a knock on the door by a drunk man trying to come in, who I had to call security to get away. At another point the door that seperates two rooms was opened by the room next door and two drunk strangers walked into my room at 1 am.

The complimentary breakfast is not WOW but it is free and it does the trick - OJ coffee toast and croissants what else do you want? The pool is nice, hottub a little small but it is nice. I got a wonderful massage by their massage therapist at a reasonable rate.

The location also cannot be beat - it is about 4 blocks from St Catherines street - lots of restaurants, shopping, museums and more shopping, a couple of blocks from both the underground and the metro.

I had nothing but amazing service when I was there, and I have constantly returned to this hotel. I came into not having my room ready and being put on the executive floor for the same rate as my other room I booked. If you needed something fixed, they came and did it as soon as possible. If you want extra pillows, Then bring your own. If your going to whine people, stay home.. Your Drama is WAY to much about; the poor and not to your par standards. Next time go stay at the Hilton where they can feed you grapes as you lie there and fan you..For those reading this, There is NOTHING wrong with the Holiday Inn.

Many others in my tour complained that it took all night for their rooms to warm. Luckily, there was an unused bed in mine whose quilt could be used. Breakfast was via menu -- no buffet that I saw -- and watch those mobs! My waitress really ran hard, kudoes to her!!!, and delivered a fairly good US-type breakfast, nothing to write home about. When I returned to Montreal a few days later I stayed a couple blocks down at the Casa Bella and played with the idea of cancelling there and returning to the Holiday Inn.

We had emailed them 2 weeks prior to ask for non-feather pillows and a fridge for our room....that didn't happen. I had to ask housekeeping to change the pillows and for extra pillows as we had requested prior, and we were told just to empty the bar fridge in the room and use that. We stayed on the executive floor....not much different then the others, definitely not worth the extra money paid. The free internet was down most of our weeklong stay. Their continental breakfast in our &quot;lounge&quot; was stale croissants and muffins. The free coffee was dirty laundry water. They rented rooms on the floor to graduating high school kids that kept us up until 4:30 am and we finally had to call hotel security because of the noise and disruption.There were 3 good things I can say......the conceirge service was impeccable, helpful and always friendly.

The sink was so cracked and stained it looked like someone had thrown up in it. It was so disgusting I had to turn my back to it to brush my teeth.To top it all off I opened up the ice bucket and found it had a foul smelling orange slime in it. How can this be acceptable? We just got back a couple of days ago and now my friend thinks he got a rash from the sheets. I have red spots all over my body that look like some sort of bites.PS.

My check-in was fine and quick, but it took me 20 minutes to check out because I was waiting in line with a bunch of people checking in. If you need to get a key for the mini-bar in your room or if you need to borrow an ethernet cable from the front desk, make sure you go it when you check in because you don't know how long the line could get if you go there later (I waited 15 minutes to get my mini-bar key and I gave up waiting). The lifts are slow and take a lot of time to use, especially when there are multiple floor stops. I got a room on the 18th floor (one of the executive floors) which was supposed to be recently renovated, but frankly I couldn't tell as the carpets already have stains and some of the lamps' electrical plugs were loose. I think the renovation was partial at best and the management decided to retain some of the existing equipment. I also had a problem with the broadband connection and an engineer came and fixed it in about 15 minutes. There's an &quot;executive room&quot; on the 19th floor with free coffee and a computer for the use of people staying on one of the executive floors, but the computer is old and slow (it runs Windows 2000 at a snail's pace), and the printer is - I couldn't believe it - dot-matrix. I guess they forgot to renovate that. A continental breakfast was included, but the croissant was soggy and it was delivered 40 minutes late. The hotel is clearly geared towards group bookings, and as long as those keep coming in, I guess management has no incentive to make the hotel any nicer than it is or to make it more user-friendly for individual travelers.\",\n",
       " 'Overall I would have to say it was not an unpleasant stay. The lobby area is nice, there never seemed to be a problem getting help from the desk agents or the concierge. The restaurant food was good, reasonably priced with good service. The bar, however, had very weak drinks and extremely poor service.Most days we would wait up to 45 minutes before a server would ask if we wanted anything and then never return for followup.The fitness center with pool and hot tub was quite nice, clean, and never overcrowded. Had the hotel not been extremely full, I would have asked for a room on a different floor.There is quite a difference in the quality of this hotel from floor to floor. Some floors are quite nice with well appointed rooms.If you are given a dingy room on a floor with ugly green carpet which is extremely stained from one end to the other and which smells of mildew, ask to be moved right away.Until those floors are remodeled, I would not say that this property is up the usual standards of Holiday Inn.',\n",
       " \"Just returned from a Memorial Day 2004 Weekend at the Holiday Inn. The hotel and the room looked their age. But, the room was clean, and the sheets did not give us a rash! The room lacked a refrigerator, and a microwave. The bathroom was quite small, but our bed was comfortable. It was a bit chilly in Montreal, but the room was warm. The staff was helpful, and there are places nearby to eat, (Check out CORA'S for breakfast, ask for directions). Not too far from the underground train system (METRO). Overall, not a bad palce to stay.\",\n",
       " \"Well, I arrived around 7pm local time on a Sunday and was fair impressed with the external appearance of the hotel, and as I wandered into reception thought &quot;Ah, nice place&quot;. If only it stayed that way. There were a number of problems I had with the hotel. Number one that became apparent was that the internet in the room didn't work at first and though they sent up an engineer, I had to diagnose the problem myself with his equipment, and even when I did he didn't understand what I was telling him. I managed to get a replacement cable from reception though, so all was well. Until the service in the room started wanting to charge me several 24 hour charges a day (charges aren't mentioned at all in the brochure for the hotel and it's the first hotel I've known to charge for internet access in rooms). Next problem, the window in my room was missing some sealant and so every time the wind blew (which was a lot on the 17th floor) I was given a rendition of some aboriginal style music. Next problem, bloody schoolkids. Maybe there's nothing the hotel can do about it, but if you book in six coachloads of obnoxious American schoolkids who love nothing more than to ride up and down the lifts incessantly, thus denying the lifts to other guests it doesn't say much about customer service. On several occassions I was left waiting up to 30 mins on a lift. What the hell is their problem? Anyway, it got so bad one time that I instead chose to (as many other guests did) walk up 17 floors (over 30 flights) of stairs in the fire exit. Next problem, I don't speak French. The voicemail system on the room's telephone systems is entirely in French with not a word of English. Next problem, when the cleaner would clear out the rubbish from my room (one night I had ordered some pizza in for myself and some friends so there were a few pizza boxes and coke bottles etc) they would leave it lying right outside my room in the corridor for several hours before someone else would come along and clean it. Oh, and the cleaners don't speak English either. I had to use primitive gestures to communicate with them as to what should be kept and what was to be thrown out.\",\n",
       " 'I have stayed at this Holiday Inn on 2 different occasions and have found it to be very comfortable, quiet, and clean; I have recently read other on-line reviews of the Inn, but I can not find anything negative to say. I plan to stay here again in March, 2004 as well. The Aces restaurant is a must do - a great breakfast!',\n",
       " \"I stayed there with my family in November 2003, after a supposed &quot;renovation.&quot; It's a great location, close to Metro stations, that huge underground mall, etc. We stayed on a non-smoking floor. However, the entire place was dated and FILTHY. Hallways were dark and dingy. There was a huge stain on the carpet in the hallway. The bathroom grout was deteriorated and discolored. The little hair drier mounted to the wall was cracked. These are all little touches, but seem so easy to fix. There is practically no noise insulation between adjoining rooms. We had to call the front desk to complain about a &quot;party&quot; next door. Worst of all, my mom got some kind of itchy rash from the bed linens. I was so embarassed I made this reservation for my family. I would definitely NOT recommend this place.\",\n",
       " \"Well me and my gurls were staying at this hotel the christmas break...let me tell U!! Where to start? Room service was horrible, tell me why they would knock at my door at 6am!! The toilets contained insects and fungus. The carpet had stains and the room stunk! The room was as small an an airplane bathroom! The doors wouldn't clothes and my neighbour was running around the floor naked! I complained but they refused to help. If u like naked old ladies, I recomend u go.\",\n",
       " 'We have just returned from a 2 night stay at the Holiday Inn, Midtown. After I booked it, I read some reviews that had me worried about how our accommodations would be. There was no need for the worry... We found the hotel to be very clean, the rooms were a good size and the staff was friendly and helpful.',\n",
       " \"My experience at the Intercontinental was somewhat polarized. On the one hand, both the hotel and the service were excellent: comfortable rooms, well-decorated, clean and with good facilities, great location (close to downtown, the Metro and the old city) helpful staff  especially Gerry the concierge, who had a wealth of knowledge and always had time to share it, his help definitely added a lot to our Montreal experience. All of this definitely deserved the high ratings and reviews.On the other hand, the hotel's policies really hampered our stay, with the nickel and diming: Internet, $15 a day (or $8 for 2 hours, there are Internet shops that make all their money from Internet services that charge less than that); Early check-in (if available), $25; Late check-out (even just a half-hour), another $25; Breakfast starts at $20 for juice, coffee and two pastries; Room service, additional fee, etc etc. It really felt like every request we had incurred an extra fee, which is absolutely not what a top-class hotel should feel like. I mean, if you were spending one night for a meeting in Montreal and your flights meant that you had to check in before 4pm and leave after noon, that's $50 extra right there, just for absolutely standard services that every other hotel (even the Holiday Inn Express brand in the same chain) is happy to offer for free! If a room is not ready for early check-in, that's perfectly understandable; but how is it fair to say your room is ready but if you don't wait around until 4pm, you have to pay extra? This isn't some kind of pay-by-the-hour flophouse!If you get a good deal on the price, I would recommend the Intercontinental. I feel kind of bad about being so negative because none of the staff provided any bad service, nor were the facilities below standard. I just feel that in a 4 or 5-star hotel, you expect to be encouraged to approach the staff, to make any requests that you need, and that the establishment should try to accommodate these out of goodwill to enhance your stay as a valued guest. By the end of my stay, I felt like it wasn't even worth asking for anything because I'd just have to pony up, or feel embarrassed to decline because of the fees. If you stay here, you will not be disappointed by the staff or the hotel  just expect to add an extra 20% or so to your quoted rate, so you don't feel disappointed by that part either.\",\n",
       " \"Stayed at the Intercontinental on business. I was very impressed with everthing, save for the valet parking.The hotel itself is very nice - lobby, bar and rooms are very nicely decorated and contemporary. My king bed was comfy and I had a great view of Mont Royal. Bathroom was big, with great standup shower. Location is handy - close to businesses on La Gauchetiere, but also not too far from Old Montreal. The building it is in in Montreal is really neatly designed. Part modern, and part retained historical buildings. In fact, the meeting rooms are acroos the bulding concourse to the historic side of the building. Very cool.I got a good business rate (179) which made it a good value. The mini bar is equipped with sensors so they knew what I had consumed before I left - which I liked because it means you don't get double billed for the mini bar. Only drawback was the valet parking. I use it and expect to pay, especailly in Montreal. The entrance for the hotel is down a level from the lobby and there was often no doorman the entrance to help with valet parking. When departing, I needed to leave in a hurry after my conference and sp personally pre-arranged with the doorman to have my car brought up at a specific time. Unfortunately, I arrived to find it not there, with no one to help me. I ended up waiting 25 minutes, which resulted in me getting caught in traffic and very late for my meeting. Pretty inexcusable for a top rated hotel. That being said, it was the only glitch so I will probably be back.\",\n",
       " \"The room has nice amenities. I liked the separate shower and bathtub and the big screen TV. The sheets and towels were in the high quality category but nothing special, the bath amenities were similarly high quality but nothing special, the staff were professional but nothing special, room service was good (for room service) but nothing special. &quot;Acceptable but nothing special&quot; describes the entire hotel, which is why the best adjective I can come up with is &quot;nice&quot;. The waiting times at reception were very long, and there never seemed to be enough help. When I checked in, the receptionist spent a solid minute explaining how the mini bar could not be tricked, as it had a computerized system with various failsafes built in. For instance, keeping the door of the minibar open for more than one minute would cause you to be charged. Needless to say, I did not feel like a welcome guest, nor did I use the minibar the entire time I was there. The staff was professional, but the amount of friendliness I experienced was directly proportional to the amount they thought I would tip. I usually tip quite well - especially for a place like Montreal, where tipping seems to be on the low 15%-ish side. Only what I consider a quite generous tip would generate any sort of genuine thanks - well, faux genuine - let's say, they put some effort into their thanks. I wasn't inspired to do that many times, only a few when I did ask for something I would consider &quot;extra&quot;. This illustrates the entire staff's attitude: I called reception the day before arrival to let them know what time our flight would be landing, and asked if they could try to have our rooms ready around 1pm (2 hours before regular check-in time). The manager's response was that for $25 per room (and we had 7 rooms) he could guarantee early check-in. I asked him if he could just be aware and _try_, and he replied that no, he could not, but that for $25 per room he could guarantee it. (Other members of our group on the same flight were staying at 3 other nearby hotels, and those hotels all agreed, with no problem, to help us with early check-in - and they provided it, too.)There were 2 better-than-blah experiences. One: I had one excellent room service meal, but only because I stopped by the restaurant and ordered from the chef's daily specials, instead of using the room service menu. Two: I received excellent service from the concierge, who I noticed wore the keys of a professional concierge on his collar. I expect his professional &quot;friendliness&quot; was more the result of his professional training, and less the result of the influence of the hotel. Only a highly conscientious professional could keep from showing their cynicism in such a working environment. I'm not giving perfect marks on cleanliness, because one of my drawers had pastry crumbs and a bakery bag left in it; and, because the pool tiles needed to be cleaned, although the water seemed well-maintained. However, I do believe that the room was generally cleaned well.I am recommending this hotel, with the above caveats, because (1) you do get exactly what you pay for - no more, but no less, either - and (2) it is directly across the street from the Palais des Congres conference center, and that is a wonderful thing if you're at a conference. If you're not at a conference, there is absolutely no reason to stay at this hotel.\",\n",
       " \"Loved Montreal, although most of the people there kept telling me Quebec was more beautiful! Stayed in a club room at the top of the hotel and the room was large, the hotel quiet and the service good. The only oddity was the club lounge was on the ground floor, behind a glass door that other guests kept knocking on, because they didn't know what the room was and how to get it. The staff in the club lounge were great and kept the coffee coming and topped up drinks before tidying away for the night.Hotel is practically in the main conference centre and is within easy walking area of the old city with its cafes and bars and restaurants. Much of Monteal seems to be covered areas and underground malls and walkways. (Kind of like Singapore, but expecting snow...) but it's worth getting out and maybe walking up to the park if work allows.\",\n",
       " 'We stayed here for 3 nights in early Novemebr, and really enjoyed our stay! It is located on the edge of Old Montreal and central to most things and close to the Metro. It was a fairly short walk to St. Catherine Street for those who like to shop! The room was quite nice and roomy, the decor was lovely. We ate at their restaurant Osco one evening and also had a drink at their Absinthe bar. Sarah. B. The staff were friendly and helpful! We did have to call 2 days in a row for more than one face cloth. High speed internet was $15 per 24 hours.',\n",
       " \"I stayed here for four days to attend a conference. The rooms are beautiful--recently renovated, very well laid out, huge marble bathrooms, comfortable beds. I was given a corner room, which was very nice. Never heard a sound from other guests. Every single staff member I encountered was very friendly. They generously let me stumble along in French, and they moved with ease between French and English.I ate dinner there the first night, and it was delicious--the scallops were especially good. The breakfast buffet was relatively modest--but in a way I liked. Most hotel buffets are too excessive. This one has just what you need--with wonderful, fresh ingredients for omelettes, which were beautifully prepared.The location was perfect for a conference, since it was just across the street from the Palais des Congres, but also close to Old Montreal. I would definitely stay there with my family. My only complaint is one that applies to most big chain, high cost hotels: 14.99/day for wireless is outrageous. You'd earn so much more loyalty if you simply made it free.\",\n",

Hit in the back of the head by plate carried by server (who did mildly apologize, but barely).

The room was large and the bathroom was very spacious. The furnishings were modern and very comfy. The room was well appointed with all the neccesities. The service was fantastic, from the front desk, valet parking, room service, concierge to housekeeping. Everyone was pleasant, gracious and very helpful.

I was upgraded to a turret room with excellent views north and west, though there are those spiders outside the windows that many others have mentioned. A couple of problems were taken care of very quickly: wine that I ordered wasn't available, but I was given something more expensive and very good instead, and at the original price. There was also a problem with my TV, but a very nice repairman visited my room quickly and took care of things. The location is excellent for those interested in seeing Old Montreal or doing shopping in the city centre; both are just a few blocks away. The rates are quite reasonable given the elegance of the hotel. I will stay here again when I return to Montreal.\",\n",

Bathrooms are large and the shower is separate from the bathtub. Service at the front desk and from the bellmen was excellent. Had the brunch the next morning and it was very good and fresh, lovely smoked salmon.Only complaint that I had was the service from one of the waitresses in the bar left a lot to be desired. Wasn't that busy there late at night and it took quite a while to get served and have her come back to see if we wanted anything more.\",\n",

The hotel has just been remodeled - its lobby area is sort of minimilist - nice but not really my taste. The room had a very comfortable king bed, sofa and large flat screen tv. The bathroom was lovely with a separate tub and shower. We parked in the parking garage which is adjacent to the hotel. No problem for us as we were just staying overnight and had little luggage - but you do have to walk through a small &quot;retail type area&quot; to get from the garage to the hotel. We found the location to be great - right on the edge of Old Montreal - we easily walked to all points in Old Montreal. Staff was very friendly.',\n",

We give them extra credit for the well-appointed bathroom and big flat-screen TV.One small suggestion  use the valet parking service, since the parking spots reserved for the public are on levels 9-12 in the underground garage!

Rooms were allocated on the 24th floor, and luggage delivery was prompt. The views from the Club floor were excellent, and the lounge a quiet haven for breakfast and afternoon drinks.Service throughout was professional and courteous, and the recent renovations of a very high standard.

We hadn't requested an early check-in, but were given a room when we tried to simply drop off our bags at 10AM. The room was average in size with nice amenities. The only thing missing was the typical hotel diectory/binder with hotel info. Also, getting a previously requested crib did take a few extra calls. For families with kids, the pool is a bit small and is really intended for lap swimming. The location is not really in the entertainment core and not really in Old Montreal - a small distance to everything but not overly far if you don't mind walking. Finally, check-out took way too long as there were not enough staff on. The TV check-out option was down too! Hopefully an isolated thing.Other people have commented on the uneven service. I think that's probably the best description. It's a great 4 star property and the service is mostly good, just not quite up to what 4 star-type people expect.\",\n",
       " 'We really liked our stay here. I was expecting somewhat blah-looking rooms (based on some of the photos Id seen) and was very pleasantly surprised to see the lobby and rooms have been redecorated very recently. The rooms carpet is a dark maroon, and the furniture is a dark brown wood. The curtains are a lovely maroon with a chrysanthemum pattern  very modern. The bathroom marble is probably old, but the fixtures looked new. We stayed in 1304, which was slightly smaller than our friends room (1311)  both with king sized beds. The lobby was also new-looking (very different from some of the photos posted by reviewers)  birch bark and fake fur. Sounds awful, but it looks elegant.The bed was nice and comfortable, soft but not mushy. Pillows were nice and soft (feather) as well.There was a nice Samsung flat screen TV, and you get an ipod docking station/radio/alarm clock (it kept going off in the mornings and we kept forgetting to figure out how to turn it off).We wandered into the bar (called Sarah B) at around 8:30pm on a Saturday night, and it was filled with families  not exactly a happening scene. But nice to know you can bring your kids there and have some beers. Theyre advertising cool absinthe drinks there, but it seems a bit out of place with the clientele.I didnt have any interaction with the concierge myself, but my friend overheard the gentleman concierge helping other guests and was very impressed. He said the concierge seemed very knowledgeable and steered the other guest toward some sensible recommendations.The internet in the room is $16 per day, and $5 for 30 min in the lobby. The concierge was nice enough to let me use the computer to quickly check my email for 5 minutes (more than that and theyd have to charge). We didnt think it was worth $16 for 30 min of internet use in the room (or for $5 in the lobby for that matter).We paid in the $80s per night for a Fri check-in and Sun check out (booked approx 3 weeks in advance on Priceline).Its in the same plaza as Toque, which is a really excellent restaurant (and very pricey).Cons:- Neighborhood is dead (need to travel to get to interesting neighborhoods)- Expensive internet access (guess thats the norm for most hotels)Pros:- Proximity to Old Montreal on foot- Nice job with renovations/redecorating- Good concierge',\n",

Firstly, hotel guests can only park on level 9 and lower so getting in and out of the garage is time consuming. Next getting from the parking to the hotel requires an evelator change and a bit of a walk to the front desk. If all that was not probelm enough, the hotel has no arrangement with the garage to allow for in and out priviledges. This means that trips to dinner etc. rack up significant parking charges.All in all its a very nice hotel but with a poor parking setup.',\n",
       " \"We received confirmation of a two night stay at in a room with two double beds. Upon arrival we were told that we had a room, but it was not one with two double beds. We were told that it is not their policy to hold such a specific request...as per their policy ( which we have yet to see in writing ), it is their policy to guarantee a room without specifics. How inane is that??? After much debate at reception, the unconcerned clerk said that she will arrange to have a cot brought in for the night and would have us moved into a room with double beds the next day. We went up to the room, changed and went out, returning at about 3:30 am, the next morning. Much to our chagrin, there was not cot in the room. The night supervisor/manager said the cot was not placed in the room because it violated fire regulations...after a long and heated argument with him, he offered to do us the &quot;favour&quot; of over riding this so called fire regulations rule and brought the cot up himself to our room. He then had the audacity to state that as a gesture of goodwill he will forgo charging us for the cot. If the windows could have opened in that room, I swear that I would have been tempted to push him out of it. The next day we were moved to the correct room....which was now without a blow dryer or an ironing board. Well at this point we were so upset by the laissez faire attitude of the staff that we decided not to complain. For all its write ups on the internet, this hotel would be rated as a 3 1/2 star in my book...The rooms were NOT spotless and through the windows, one could see 4 or five spiders outside. I WILL NOT RECOMMEND THIS HOTEL TO ANYONE!!!!!!!!!!!. By the way, the hotel didn't even offer to refund the difference between for the single room we stayed in the first night and the double we originally paid for...\",\n",
       " \"I would first off like to say that I am very disappointed with this hotel. I've always enjoyed my stays at Intercontinental hotels. We traveled with my 18 month son so we needed a mini fridge for his milk. I asked about it and the lady at the front desk said that they don't offer a mini fridge option; there are minibars in the room but they have sensors so we would be charged every time we moved something. We decided to just order milk through room service. The next day we did so and one glass of milk was $6, typical room service prices but since we were there for 5 days we didn't want to spend that much. We decided to check at the front desk again. We asked a young lady what our options are and she said that they could look into emptying out the mini bar for us to use. Another young lady at the front desk chimed in that they can't empty the mini bar but we can get a mini fridge in the room for $40/night. That would be $160 for the trip, the price of buying our own fridge! I've traveled all over the world and have never run into this problem. At any rate there did not seem to be any construction while we were there. The rooms were clean and the concierge was very helpful in finding baby friendly restaurants for us. I just wished they were a little more understanding about the fridge.\",\n",
       " \"I was a bit hesitant about staying here since the reviews were so mixed; however I found this hotel to be great and suitable to our needs. For anyone that is concerned about the construction, there should be no worries. The construction is really just a renovation that is confined to just the lounge/bar area. No noise or dust anywhere. The staff were friendly and extremely accomodating. The manager hooked us up with a room upgrade to a suite room! We also received a lot of great recommendations on where to sight-see (Parc du Mont-Royal) and where to drink/eat (Weinstein and Gustovino's). Our suite room (Room 1000) is modern and nicely laid out. There were several issues that we did notice, however did not really bother us all that much: No hairdryer (front desk asked us to look in the cabinet under the sink, but it was a pedestal sink!), the bed was VERY firm and the linens a bit rough for my silky smooth skin. Oh, and just a side note, there were spiders on the exterior of the building; no possible way of getting in, but did anyone else notice that all of montreal is just crawling with spiders all over the place???Parking was a bit odd. Hotel guests have to park in P-9/P-10 which is 9/10 flights below(we got a bit dizzy going in circles). The elevator is right there, although it only goes as far up to the Food Court level. You then have to walk up a flight of stairs to the lobby to check-in. Because of this set up, there is no one to help you with your luggage if you do self parking. Odd.Overall, I really enjoyed staying here and would gladly stay here again. The neighborhood is a bit dead during the weekends, however the Metro is right in the colorful convention center across the street and everything is within a 10 minute walk.\",\n",
       " \"I was hesitant to stay here because of some of the reviews I read. However I had a great experience. The hotel is located within 5 minutes walking distance to the heart of Old Montreal and 8 minutes walking distance to downtown/ St. Catherine's. It is very close to other hotels, there is a cafe around the corner and down the street, however it is not extremely close to popular eateries (starbucks, etc.) except for a Steak Frites place across the street. The hotel itself is very nice. Although it is under renovations, the reno's are confined to the main level area and make the lobby a bit smaller than expected. However the rooms are not affected and you cannot hear any construction noise. The conceirge is on the lobby level and was extremely friendly and helpful, the front desk staff were somewhat friendly, and the bell staff are located on the street level and are very friendly as well. The hotel provided umbrellas for rainy days, free printing of boarding passes, complementary slippers (but you have to ask) and free luggage storage when you check out.The room I had contained 2 queen beds and had very dark decor which I didn't like, but it was clean and large. The pool was long and narrow but was nice enough. The spa had a steam room that was lovely. The gym seemed like a good facility although I did not use it - it had a treadmill and weights and other cardio machines.The area is safe and I would stay here again. However, as this hotel is not in the heart of old Montreal, walking back at night is somewhat lonely as there aren't too many people around. It could be spooky if you are a single traveller. The other thing is that when you check in they automatically charge you for newspaper delivery each night you are there. If you don't read the check in contract you are billed for this - make sure you decline if you don't want this service. Also, room service is VERY expensive.I booked it on priceline for $105 USD per night.\",\n",
       " \"Travelled to Montreal with my sister in law and 11 yr old daughter and 9 year old niece. Stayed at the Intercontinental from July 10-July 13 for family party on the Saturday. Montreal is my hometown but moved over 20 years ago and only seem to get down for family functions and never spend anytime in this wonderful city. so decided to stay a few days and play tourist in the city I grew up in. The Intercontental is in a perfect spot. Walking distance to both Old Montreal and Downtown. We arrived Friday night and took the valet service since we were too tired to find parking and it was around 27 per day and we did not plan to use the car too much during our stay.Reception is not thru the main door but up the escalators to your right thru sliding glass doors.Check in was smooth and easy and we were on the 17th floor with a view of Old Montreal and surrounding area.The hotel is still under some construction to what looks like a restaurtant or lounge.The rooms were fabulous but after reading some reviews about no mini fridge I brought a small cooler which I kept full with ice to keep juice and milk cold for the girls and beer cold for the grownups.There is a mini bar but I stay away from those. Not in the mood to pay 8.50$ for a bottle of water.Coffee/Tea maker in the room. Only one coffee and one tea per day but it worked out since my sister in law is the coffee drinker and I am a tea lover and never needed to ask for more which I read from previous reviews you get charged for.........not sure if that policy changed.The pool was more of a lap pool but big enough for the kids to swim and was not very busy. It is located on the 10th floor with an outside deck with not much of a view except an office building across the street. I did not stay out there since there were spider webs everywhere. Definately needs some attention.We walked around Old Montreal on Saturday and even bought last minute tickets to Cirque du Soleil &quot;Ovo&quot; for a matinee at 1:00pm. The tickets are pricey but cheaper than in Las Vegas. We had the best seats and the best view and paid 120$ per adult and 91$ per child under 12. I know in Vegas it was 165$US for one of their shows for the good seats. We walked thru all the streets and there are many restaurants to chose from and many art galleries and souvenir shops. We were not there for the shopping but bought a beautiful bracelet in the Bonsecour market on rue St Paul. Ins ide the building there are maybe 15 boutiques with all handmade stuff including glass and leather. worth a look. We took a caleche ride....horse and buggy....for 45$ a half hour and it was a treat for the girls to learn the history of Montreal. The Vieux Port by the water was fun to walk around with more shops and there is a place for kids called the Labrynthe but they were not interested in visiting. Sunday we took the car and went to the mountain...Mount Royal/Beaver Lake(Lac aux Castors). I always laugh at the word lake. It is a man made pond with paddle boats. We walked around and enjoyed the view from the top of down town Montreal. We jumped in the car and visited St Joseph's Oratory and learned the history of this magnificent church on the top of the mountain. Sunday night was the last night of the Jazz festival which was a 5 minute walk from the hotel. We stayed for about an hour since the girls were getting tired but enjoyed some of the free music on rue St Catherine. Sorry for the long review but wanted to cover everything.\",\n",
       " \"Very disappointed in Intercontinental, after entering the room, was about to put my bags on the desk then I saw, there were heavy dust on the top part of the desk as in, where people use the least. I simply passed my finger and I can actually see dust on my finger tip. I then called front desk, they sent the housekeeper up and clean it. Can't believe before the concierge left, she told me that one person hs to clean average 15 rooms within two days. After she left, i was about to put my other bags on a reading chair near corner end, I then saw an empty 7 up bottle hidden under the chair. If i didn't slightly pushed the chair by accident, i probably wouldn't know THE ROOM WASN'T CLEAN AT ALL. Asked for an room exchange because didn't want to guess elsewhere wasn't clean. 2nd room, still dusty on the desk, the front desk claims the hotel just finished renovation therefore for sure there would be dust. BUT isn't a 4 stars hotel HAS TO MAKE SURE THE ROOM IS CLEAN BEFORE THE GUEST ENTERING THE ROOM ?? THIS IS LIKE THE BASIC.I still couldn't believe that &quot;renovation&quot; was the excuse they use. If they knew there would be dust because of the renovation which ended end on June. WOW after two weeks, still very dusty, unbelievable!!!! OVERALL, disappointed 4 stars hotel FAILED on a very basic requirement, Cleanness!!\",\n",
       " \"Lovely hotel, well-located directly adjacent to Vieux Montreal (Old Montreal) and about a 10-15 minute walk from Centre Ville (Downtown) The Metro is about a 5 minute walk. Newly renovated, the rooms are spacious, beautifully decorated and well-appointed. The very large marble bath with separate tub and shower is top notch. Primarily a convention/business hotel, it can feel a bit stuffy and corporate... definitely not the best choice for a romantic rendez-vous.A downside is that the quality of the service was uneven. The employees were generally pleasant and professional, but the hotel seemed understaffed with long wait times to speak with the concierge, unanswered phone calls to room service, and occasional long lines at the front desk. The quality of room service food was poor considering the high prices.I would hesitate to pay full price for the hotel, but there seem to be many heavily discounted rates available from various online site. At a discounted price, it's a very good deal.\",\n",
       " 'Although this hotel is attractive, it is not a four star hotel. We bid $100 and got it for six nights at $122 per night. Good location, close to old Montreal and the jazz festival. Good concierge, but hotel staff did not inform us of free coffee in the lobby nor that all calls, including 800 would be charged $1.50. Room was comfortable and attractive.',\n",
       " \"The hotel was one of the best that I've ever stayed in. It's located close to everywhere, we parked our car ($18 /day) and walked everywhere. You could take the Metro, it's close by. But we decided to walk since our destinations are within walking distance (Old Montreal, St. Catherine, etc). The bed is so comfy, we had a large LCD tv in our room, separate shower and bath, front desk was very nice. I guess we were there where the construction/renovation was done. We had a room that had a connecting door and could hear people from next room taking shower, coughed and sneezed in the middle of the night. Didn't bother me that much because after a few minutes it stopped and I didn't hear anything else. One thing that I wish this hotel would have is free internet access or at least a cheaper rate. The internet rate was expensive, we couldn't get browse the web trying to get directions or places to go.\",\n",
       " '8 of us came to Montreal for a stag celebration. Although the hotel lobby is under renovations (finished in end of June) the rooms are fully made up. Quiet during the day and clean, the thing I remember most is the nice soft fluffy beds and pillows that were so inviting when we retired at 5am in the morning. Sound proofing is excellent in this hotel and no complaints filed against us in the am. Location is good for the Old Montreal area, otherwise there is very handy taxi stand in the front. Walk to Crescent street is about 20 mins, St. Catherines central in about 10-15. There is a Steak Frites restaurant that is a BYO beer and wine across the street. It is connected to a mall with a food court with food for lunch and maybe breakfast.',\n",
       " \"We just got back from a five nigths trip to Montreal. The hotel is under construction and the entrance is just not professional and appealing. You have to change elevators to go to your room, the hotel restaurant is just dark, smells funny and the food is just okay. The staff are nice and helpful but we didn't receive the four star service at all, they are definitely short staffed and can not handle the construction. You would think if an Intercontinental Hotel is going through construction, they would at least higher more staff or at least really go out of there way to make up for the situation.We asked for slippers four times during our stay and we never received it. The concierge was very unprofessional and would only send you to places that he probably gets free meals. ( the two places that recommended for dinners were just not what he claimed)He didn't care about the quality of the places which he recommended and didn't even listen to what we were looking for. We ended up going to another hotel and tipped the concierge to get good and helpful recommendations for restaurants and interesting areas.They give you free breakfast and free drinks coupons to compensate for it but it really doesn't change the experience. We went to Hotel James which is right next to the Intercontinental and checked out the hotel, restaurant and the quality of service was just superb. Next time we are in Montreal we would definitely stay at Hotel James. I would not recommend this hotel at this state maybe when they are done with the construction they would be different but I wouldn't go back again.\",\n",
       " \"I have to admit I was nervous when I saw the reviews most recently. However, we truly enjoyed our stay at the Intercontinental. The lobby is still being renovated so the check-in process is a bit unusual but the staff makes you feel very welcome. The rooms are now renovated and ours was excellent. We stayed on the 17th floor. Large flat screen TV, nice coffee maker, high speed internet and wireless (for a fee with our room rate). The bathroom was very nice and everything was very clean. The location is good as well. Only a few steps from the Metro located only a few blocks from the Notre Dame Basilica (a must see). We didn't use the pool, gym or restaurant so cannot comment on those. However, Gerry, the concerige was very helpful in getting us to and from sites/places. Very friendly and very helpful. All in all, a very pleasant stay. Our rate was through Priceline so the deal for us was excellent (~$100/night).\",\n",
       " \"...a note to my travel consultant...I wasn't going to say anything however I felt I should nevertheless do so. Whilst it was great to have spent a few (very cold) days in Montreal for the first time over this past weekend ('09), you do need to know for future reference that the Intercontinental Hotel (Montreal, Quebec, Canada) was seriously one of the worst hotels we've ever stayed in, anywhere. We had serious reservations upfront about staying in 'anything InterContinental', but were happy to overlook them, not least of all as it seemed like a good 'easter weekend' deal. They are however in the process of a major renovation, which is fine to a degree, but not when one isn't warned of this upfront and where virtually (i.e. literally) every service within the establishment suffered accordingly - and made a mockery of their 'weekend special'. The above concerns/ reservations were further confirmed upon entering our 'newly renovated stale-smelling straight out of the early seventies maroon room' - reservations that were re-inforced whenever one needed to for example phone any service within the establishment (a challenge all of it's own) and for instance request towels or that old room-service crockery be removed, etc., as happened incidentally each day. I used to be in the hotel biz many years ago, so perhaps I tend to notice small things. The trouble was that our numerous not unjustified 'complaints' ranging from room service to housekeeping to not even having someone to assist us with our luggage upon arrival, were rather larger service issues. The noticeable lack of any visible senior management merely exacerbated the above service deficiencies, despite the friendly attitude and efforts of the long-suffering front house staff, working under ridiculous makeshift conditions. Also just for the record, it's not truly in the old quarter, no matter what is claimed to the contrary.The above was all put in writing at their request upon our departure, if I were you however I would seriously hesitate ever recommending this hotel/ group to anyone in the future. Needless to say I have never heard a single word from anyone at the hotel apropos the unnaceptable level of service received.\",\n",
       " \"This would have been a beautiful &amp; awesome hotel ONLY IF it wasn't under renovation while we were there. There currently is no lobby, &amp; the hallways are definitely unfinished.  However, at least the renovation of the rooms were complete as our superior room had a very nice bathroom (separate shower &amp; tub) &amp; giant LCD TV.Location wise, it was close to our 2 most frequented places: Chinatown &amp; Old Montreal.If only we had a come a couple months later when the renovations were complete...\",\n",
       " 'This could possibly be a nice location although being in the business district, the shops were closed on the weekends. The hotel is undergoing extensive renovations which mean no common space, no bar, no restaurants. Not even a lobby which was now located in a converted room.The room service was late and unresponsive to our concerns (tar tar sauce with chicken?). There are definately better values in Montreal.',\n",
       " \"I stayed at the Intercontinental Montreal in April 2009. We got a fantastic rate through Travelzoo and knew that the renovations weren't complete yet. Check in was quick. We had a newly renovated room (with a big screen tv). The room was a good size, clean, and had a very large bathroom, with separate shower and tub. The hotel was very quiet, despite that the renovations are still ongoing for the restaurant area on the 2nd floor. Our rate included internet, though it is normally about $14 a day. Hotel location was great, and the Metro can be accessed without going outside. The only reason I didn't give 5 star was because the lobby area was a bit disorganized (but this is because of the renovations).\",\n",

One receptionist on duty. Staff all were very pleasant and room was fine.Not the kicker, ordered room service on saturday without checking menu and prices. Ordered OJ, coffee and oatmeal and the bill was $34-I am not kidding. Staff said c'est la vie!!! Quality was just OK-not even water came with the order. Clearly this property is not close to being a 4 star - avoid, avoid, avoid!!!\",\n",

The current refurbishing didn't bother us at all.The pool was too cold ; didn't try the gym.Toiletries in the room are Elemis (mmmmm!!)Towels, sheets , pillows are spotless clean and in abundance.I recommend trying the underground (metro) which is so clean and efficient, and visiting the Biodome with kids.Overall, as I said, I found the place really good, but somehow wouldn't stay more than 2 nights as there isn't much to do (in winter that is) and the pool is too cold.\",\n",

They were doing some remodeling, so the lobby area was a little confusing and you had to take 2 elevators to get upstairs. The spa/exercise/pool area was very nice and we really enjoyed swimming and the steam/sauna. We were there during snow and cold so it was nice to have things to do inside. The location is good and you can get to the subway without going outside at all. All in all a great deal!',\n",

The luggage boys are great, they are in the entrance of the hotel 24/7 always smiling and assisting you. The rooms are great. The pool is a bit small, but good enough, and it closes at 10pm, in my opinion it should be opened 24/7 just like the gym. Everything is perfect, I would definatly recommend it !',\n",
       " \"experience I have ever had. Let's begin with the fact that I made the reservation at the same time as my brother and he got a rate 50% cheaper then I did for a smaller room then mine. When I asked for a match they refused. That was fine. I was willing to pay what was quoted. When I got there at 3pm for check-in my room was not ready and I was told I would have to wait at least an hour. Around 4:30pm my room was ready. I walk into my room only to find out that it also belonged to someone else. Imagine my embarrassment walking into someone else's room!!!! Luckily, no one was there. When I returned to the front desk I asked to speak to the Hotel Manager to complain. The manager offered me an upgrade of my room for the mishap, however when I got my new room it was the exact same room with a worse view! When I called to complain about that the manager yelled at me, told me there was nothing he can do for me (oh he did offer me complimentary breakfast the next morning. Woo Hoo) and that I needed to understand that they were full. When I asked him how many stars did the Hotel have his response was 'we strive to be a 5 star'. I don't think that they will accomplish that with such poor leadership in place. I called the corporate offices to make a formal complaint and then the Manager called me back to yell at me some more for being inconsiderate and ungrateful for the offer of a complimentary breakfast! I finally got him to reduce my rate (I still paid more then my brother did), however the problems persisted. My showerhead was broken, the bathroom wallpaper was falling off, and the iron did not work. I will say the housekeeping and concierge staff were very helpful and kind, however the overall experience was horrendous. I will never stay at another Intercontinental or any other Hotel in their chain!\",\n",

The first room 1724 faced the The Palais des congrs, Montrals Convention Centre, known for its massive multi-coloured glass wall (and Tim Horton's inside) and Place Jean-Paul-Riopelle a lovely park with special effects along the pathways and in the fountain (hint: ring of fire). The kids loved the view. In the distance we could see the Mount Royal. The second room 2016 was on the opposite side of the hotel facing the St. Lawrence River. The rooms are average size with very comfortable beds, the bathrooms are very nice with a soaking tub and separate shower. The staff were extremenly poilte and helpful. I do not speak French and was pleased to find that the staff would immediatly switch to English based on my greeting. This hotel is connected to the underground pedestrian walkways. My only complaint was that there was no shop in the hotel or even within the block and the mini bar prices were very high. Plan ahead for snacks and drinks. The indoor pool on the 10th floor was small but adequate to entertain a 10 yr old and connected to an nice outdoor patio with several tables and chairs.

Everything is within walking distance. Subway station is right by the hotel and train station is about 10 min walk. Hotel itself was beautiful. Marble, art work, expensive furniture and flowers everywhere. The entrace is kind of unusual - you have to take elevator to the lobby. We stayed here for 2 nights but didn't have a chance to try restaurant. We always ate out. Hotel is adjacent to a mall with interesting shops and cafes. We found it very convenient. Our suite was amazing. It was a corner room with oval shape. We had a nice view of park and the colorful Palace of Congress (exhibition hall). The suite had lot of light and warm colors. Living room was very comfortable. TV channels were also in English. Bed had the nicest sheets and comforter ever. They made it hard for us to get up. Closet was a descent size. Bathroom was perfect. Fluffy robes were new and smelled nice. We also got very nice bathroom amenities. I forgot the name of the brand. Service was exceptional except for concierge who could have smiled more. However, she provided good directions everywhere, plenty of maps and recommendations. Actually everybody was very efficient, knowledgable and professional. The staff went out of their way to help us, especially front desk and bell men (they stored our luggage and got us taxi few times). I will stay here again and recommend this hotel to all my friends.\",\n",

You have to call if you want turn down , and then it does not always come. The bellmen/doormen can often not be bothered to assist because they are so involved in their own conversation. The concierge is happy to say, &quot;I don't know&quot;, and leave it at that. Room service prices were exorbitant, e.g. $7.50 for a bowl of dry cereal plus service and delivery. Internet is $14.50 a day. Furnishings in the rooms and public areas were dark, worn, and dated. Plastic flowers and low lighting.All this is acceptable in a three star hotel, or if the rate is $95 through Priceline.

       " \"Situated between Old Montreal and downtown, this hotel was a perfect location for sightseeing and shopping. The staff person at the desk was very helpful, as we got to Montreal at 1:30 in the morning, and they even upgraded our room to a King size bed! The room itself was absolutely perfect, the bathroom spotless and in excellent repair. It had a marble shower as well as a bathtub,and it was all as clean as clean is possible. Even though it was a 'smoking' room, you could not smell any hint of cigarettes, and it was not stale from any artificial fragrance either. fyi, the internet usage in the business center is $5 per half hour, and the parking is $26 for the day(!), but don't drive in the city because the parking meters are even more expensive, and good luck finding parking.

It is within walking distance of Old Montreal. There is also a shopping center under the hotel, but it seemed to close rather early.The room is spacious, and the bathroom includes a separate tub and shower. Service was fine once I got there. However, I e-mailed the hotel ahead of time to add my Priority Club number and room preferences and never got a response. My preferences did seem to be noted, however, and I received the type of room I wanted at check-in.The room includes a coffee maker, but unlike most hotels where I have stayed, you have to pay extra if you want tea. The coffee maker is located in the bathroom with one bag of coffee and a note stating that if you want more coffee or if you want tea, you can purchase it from the minibar. I thought it was very petty to make guests pay for a tea bag. This is just one example, but as other guests have mentioned, the hotel seems to charge for pretty much everything.The room service menu was very expensive and did not offer a lot of good options.The room and common areas are well-appointed and very clean. It is a very nice hotel, but just be aware that everything is an extra charge.',\n",
       " \"We stayed at this hotel for a bachelor's party. There were about 20 of us that stayed in various floors throughout the building. I got this off Hotwire for $92/nt double beds. The beds were quite comfortable, rooms were average size. Hotel reception was very friendly, and helped cater to your needs (although we're young so we don't really complain about services). The bathroom was cool in that it had a separate shower/bath tub. The place was clean, and the AC kept the room very comfortable. My gripes are that there is not 1 vending machine in the building and no open convenience stores nearby. So at 3am after the clubs and drinking, you have no choice but to open the $10 Fiji water or get room service. The Hotel is also a bit far from shops/restaurants/downtown (although there are 2 fancy places to eat across the street). Old Montreal is close, but still a good 10-15 min walk to get there. Internet was $15 per day, which I found rather absurd in this day of technology. Overall I enjoyed my stay here and would definitely stay again.\",\n",

Ate lunch and dinner out at other restaurants.Dissapointed that they charged us for using coffee service in room - should be complementary each day, not just one time.They charged us for tea and a chocolate bar.

       " \"Booked via Priceline 91$ AI.This is not the first time we stayed here. And I was pleased to find out when I won my bid.The hotel is well located re: downtown and old Montreal. For a cyclist, this is a good spot to start exploring the city's paths. The rooms are stylish and romantic, with sumptuous beds, spacious bathroom and bathrobe, although the view from the window was not the best. The lobby is stylish , attached to the Centre de Commerce International. Weekday and Saturday, just walk down to the food courts if you want to avoid the pricey restaurant. The pool is smallish but lengthwise, provides good swimming. Good gym too.\",\n",

The bedding was lovely, the bathroom was spacious. I would certainly recommend this hotel. One aside- You'll need to take the subway or a cab to get around the city. Old Montreal and Chinatown are both within walking distance of the hotel, other points of interest need the easily maneuverable metro system.\",\n",

       " \"My wife and I and our infant son stayed at the Montreal Intercontinental for one night on May 20th. We found our stay to be very comfortable, as well as a very good price for the amenities of the hotel. We bid $80 on Priceline, and our bid was accepted. While I wouldn't say that the Intercontinental is a &quot;true&quot; four star, due to the slightly dated rooms and uneven service by the front desk, it was certainly a bargain compared to 2* hotels near the airport that were priced on expedia at twice that rate.We had flown in from London, and were just spending the night on the way to Vermont the following day. The Intercontinental was very simple to find, and a very easy spot from which to leave the city the following day.Upon arrival, we were greeted immediately by a doorman who saw to our luggage and parked the car (although at $26 for parking, it was a bit expensive). We were checked in promptly enough (it was 9:00 pm) by a trainee front desk person, who was a bit uncertain about how to issue us keys, but there were no delays. At the front desk, we requested a portable crib (no extra cost) for our son, and it was delivered within five minutes of getting to our room.The room itself was plenty spacious, with a decent view of the old town. The beds were comfortable and there was ample storage for our bags and clothing. The bathroom was large, with a shower and a separate bathtub. Shampoos and soaps by Elemis were a nice touch as well. The bed coverings, curtains and rugs could have used updating, but they were all clean and well looked after. There was also a coffee maker with one free pot of coffee.Having come in from London and being pretty tired, we ordered room service. Even on a night when the hotel appeared to be empty, we could not reach room service directly. The hotel operator took our message, and room service returned our call in 10 minutes. Delivery was approximately 45 minutes later. The food was only adequate, nothing remotely special, and for the prices ($19 for a very small pizza), was not worth it.Check-out was easy the next day, and they did give me Admiral's club credit, even though I had booked through Priceline, which was a bonus.In sum, aside from the expensive and uninteresting room service menu, the hotel more than met our expectations in terms of delivering good value for the money.\",\n",
       " \"I found an incredible deal on a room at the Inter-Continental through Hotwire and booked it as a surprise birthday present for my boyfriend. The staff were uniformly friendly. professional and engaging, and the room was as expected for a 4-star hotel. The location is really convenient; a subway stop and all local amenities are within easy walking distance (even in Montreal's January cold. brrr). The room we were given was in the 17th floor and looked like it could do with a bit of a renovation; there were some corners where wallpaper had started to peel away from the wall, and some of the furnishings looked a little faded. The gym was great, it was filled with old-school fixed weight systems which allowed you to work specific muscle groups. They were really sturdy and of good quality, even if they weren't the latest. There were also of course the usual electronic elliptical trainers as well. I didn't get a chance to use the pool as it was closed for the evening when we arrived. Overall I would love to return especially during off-peak seasons and definitely if there was another deal on Hotwire.\",\n",

I took the train in from Dorval (near airport) and walked from the commuter train stop to the hotel. This is about a mile but the day was beautiful.The lunch restaurant Gourmand and Olives was a neat bistro with many local people.

Struck me as a little less than 4 star Hotel more like a Red Roof Inn. The hotel is connected to the underground. Many restaurants within walking distance but if you go in the winter bring good boots. The morning buffet in the Hotel was 30.00 (US) per person. I would love to go back to Montreal in the warmer weather, A beautiful city to explore.',\n",

The room had two comfortable chairs to watch TV and the bed was also very nice. We reserved through Priceline.',\n",
       " \"Always wanted to stay at an Intercontinental. It was a typical 4 star hotel. Didn't like that during the cold season, it is a bit of a walk to St. Catherine street. You can take the metro but they blast the heat down there...it's unbearable. You're better off cabbing it. The comforter was wonderful...fluffy down. Pool was perfect for the kids. The bar has the best onion soup ever! You're only bet for coffee from Monday evening-Monday early a.m. is in the hotel but it's $5. During workweek hours, there's an underground mall attached and it's a bit cheaper down there. There was broken glass by the bed and my son stepped on it. The head of housekeeping came up and gave us a bandaid and some ointment and had it vacuumed. I would stay again if the weather was a bit milder but in the cold, I'd select something more centrally located..better yet, I won't be back until it's milder!!! We froze our butts off!\",\n",
       " \"I got this hotel on priceline for 2 rooms at $70 each a night.There were 5 of us adults so I had called ahead to request 2 double non-smoking rooms and when we got there that is what we were given.I asked if the rooms were next to each other and was told that was only possible if we had king beds, so we said &quot;ok, no problem&quot; but she moved us up 6 floors so that our rooms were only 2 rooms apart!This gave both rooms a great view of the snow-covered city and rooftops, including the river and Biosphere.The rooms themselves were perfect, very large, big bathrooms with seperate showers and tub. Bathrobes and slippers were provided and the double beds were large enough for my parents to share.After a few nights someone mentioned &quot;i think this is the most comfortable bed I have ever slept in&quot; and the other 4 of us all agreed! The pillows were not as nice as the Conrad in Istanbul (the best pillows we have ever had) but the beds were amazing!The gym &amp; pool was closed on christmas day (we stayed from the 25th-30th) and had limited hours the next day, but were open at 6am on the 27th. I even brought in my 7 year-old cousin who lives in Montreal and we had a wonderful time at the pool.The staff was very nice and did everything to make our stay perfect, we were never treated differently for using priceline. We even added an extra night using priceline ($70 wasn't possible but we got the rooms for $90 which is still a great deal).The hotel told us that they will be renovating soon to compete with the 5 star hotels downtown, but we found this hotel to be perfect already!The only thing I would warn about would be that parking is $30 a day (includes valet) but you can park on the street for much less if you plan to use your car during most of the daytime!\",\n",
       " \"I have stayed at the Intercontinental in Montreal several times over the years and have always had a pleasant stay. Booked through Hotwire on this stay, arrived at 11pm with my son and were told there were no rooms with two beds available. So they put us in a king bedded room and we were forced to pay $35 for the rollaway bed. While I understand that the hotel cannot guarantee specific room configurations, I don't feel it is fair or appropriate to be charged excessively for an extra bed when there are only two people in the room in the first place and the hotel can't provide a room with two beds. I did talk to the front office manager about it after our stay, and although he was pleasant and professional, his explanation was that it was a labor charge. I find it very hard to believe that it cost $35 to have a staff member bring the bed in and out of the room. More importantly, it was the first time I can ever remember being charged for an extra bed. Other than that, the hotel was comfortable, although after 15 years, soon in need of freshening and updating. Unlikely to return if only because of the extra bed charge.\",\n",

Will always use the Hotel when in Montreal on business if the standards stay as good as they are.',\n",
       " \"I have mixed feelings about this hotel. On the one hand, it is nicely located for business at the Palais des Congress, has a helpful and friendly staff, and is comfortable. On the other hand, there were many small details that, when put together, made this a rather disappointing Intercontinental experience. I was surprised and disappointed that this Intercontinental was not at the standard of others where I have stayed, such as the Intercontinental Amman. I will find another hotel next time I am in Montral.Like other reviewers, I definitely felt &quot;nickled and dimed&quot; at this hotel. You are given only one small coffee packet in your room for free each night, and each one after that costs $2.50! Hair Conditioner is not provided, and the hotel charges for forgotten amenities, such as toothpaste. These are things that other hotels of this class give away &quot;for free&quot; without question. (I don't really consider these items &quot;free&quot; since they should be considered part of the money you're paying for the room.) The wireless internet in the rooms was very expensive ($14.95/24 hours) and literally put up an annoying popup window that had to be dismissed every two minutes!!!!!! It also required me to re-order it several times, forcing me to call down twice to be certain my bill wasn't being charged multiple times. The room service was very delicious and quick to arrive, but far more expensive than other places of this class. Also, the rooms and the general design of the hotel are average at best. I expect a lot more from Intercontinental and was disappointed in the boring decor and less-than-spotless cleanliness. The shower was NOT CLEAN. There was mold in the grouting and that is completely unnecessary for a shower that is obstensibly cleaned each and every day. The carpet was stained, and the wallpaper in my bathroom was peeling. Also, the television was small and outdated. I spent four nights in this hotel, and got ill during my trip, so I was in my room more than I intended, and was really disappointed in the surroundings. that being said, The bed was extremely comfortable and the linens were soft and clean. I liked the towels, too, and the shower had good water pressure. The desk was comfortable to work at as well. The staff were friendly and efficient, and I liked the 1pm checkout time very much. I think this hotel is perfectly acceptible, but you can also do much better. It needs a makeover and a stylist, updated decor and a touch of class--even the W doesn't charge you if you want to brew more than one pot of coffee in your room!!!!! Intercontinental can do a lot better than this!\",\n",
       " 'Excellent front desk service. Amazing view from the top if you get a window room. Great location for &quot;business&quot; downtown (offices, conferences, etc). A little far from &quot;fun&quot; downtown (shopping, tourists areas, bars, etc). Excellent rooms and the elevator is so fast I went from the 9th floor to the lobby in a blink.',\n",
       " 'Stayed at the hotel during my business trip and fully enjoyed the hotel. It was very easy to check in and out. It is within walking distance of Old Montreal and downtown ( a couple of blocks from St. Catherine and Metro). The king bed was comfortable in corner spacious room. The housekeeping never was late and had everything impeccably prepared. The TV is small, but the views were fantastic (12 th floor) even with the construction on the East side. I checked out but kept my bags with the bellmen for a $1 a bag. It was very convenient. I would recommend a stay for any business traveler.',\n",
       " 'This was our second long weekend at the Intercontinental this summer. This was over labor day weekend. We arrived very late Friday night and were immediately checked into our Ambassador upgrade which was a large corner, club level room facing the St. Lawrence. It was a lovely, quiet room. The club lounge breakfast had wonderful fruit and berries (as usual) as well as cereals, breads and muffins. The afternoon service included wine and cheese and a small selection of hot and cold dishes. It was a relaxing break.We utilized concierge services which were very helpful and valet services for our car, also on point.The area around the hotel has changed so much over the last few years and I find it much more in the center of things. I think that we are pretty demanding travelers who have enjoyed staying in some of the top hotels in the world and while the Intercontinental in Montreal is not in THAT category, it is an excellent hotel in a wonderful area.',\n",
       " 'We stayed at the hotel for 2 nights and were very happy with our choice. We reserved a room with a king size bed and felt that the room was a good size, everything was very clean and modern, and it had a nice bathroom with a separate shower and bathtub. We were in room 1806 and had a nice view of the harbour and a bit of downtown. Id caution anyone staying on this side of the building because theyre in the process of building something across the street and as we were checking in, a couple were complaining about the noise and asked to be moved. Luckily there wasnt any construction while we were there but hopefully being on the 18th floor we wouldnt have heard much. (After over hearing the complaint we asked to be on a different side of the building which they couldnt accommodate but they did move us to a higher floor to hopefully escape any noise.)The location was nice as its very close to Old Montreal but only a short walk to St. Catherine street.I read a previous review that the persons room was charged for something that didnt apply to them. Our room was charged for a buffet breakfast that wasnt ours (which they removed after confirming the mix up with the restaurant) and we over heard another guest explaining that they hadnt taken anything out of the mini bar which had been charged to their room. A minor inconvenience but it seems to happen quite often at this hotel!The staff was very polite, the room was very clean and spacious, we liked the location and would definitely stay here again. Well worth the $133 we paid for a 5 star hotel.',\n",
       " \"I stayed here with my wife and 1 year old son, the hotel is located right beside Old Montreal like 200 meters away and also right by downtown for shopping and the best restaurants, we walked the whole weekend, the lobby is very nice but located on the second floor with an escalator this could be a problem with a baby stroller or people with disabilities, we asked for another way down and they gave us a special key and a guided tour of how to use it . I was very impressed with the service we received I would recommend using the valet parking, there's something about just dropping you car off at the front door and taking you belongings and thats it, when you need you car again you call and its there $26 per day no limits in or out, no hidden costs, because i've heard about the hidden cost of self parking which is $19 and you can't leave or you'll be charged another fee, by the way the hotel doesn't run the parking lot, The porter that helped us with are bags was very helpful and pleasant, also the front staff was also good.. so to sum it all up highly recommend hotel, if you want cheap go to a cheap hotel this is a high class hotel for high class people (I'm not, I just pretend on my holidays)\",\n",
       " 'We looked forward to this hotel even after the bad reviews. As an Ambassador I am guaranteed a room upgrade upon checkin and we were given a suite. Entering the suite we almost needed a gas mask as the room reeked of smoke, we had specified a month ago for a non smoking room. The front desk then pushed us back into our original club room that we had booked with no explanation for an upgrade the next day perhaps.The club lounge was closed on Saturday, we arrived friday night. Upon asking front desk they advised that since someone called in sick they had to close the lounge. That is a manegement issue right here. We were then allowed to have breakfast in the restaurant.No greetings by the doormen or front desk each time you entered or exited the hote. Overall not a pleasant stay. I would highly recommend the Fairmont Hotel in Montreal. An excellent location right above the VIA rail train station and close to everything downtown.',\n",
       " \"My wife and I traveled from Boston to Montreal for our 1-year anniversary and stayed at the Intercontinental Montreal. I booked the room using priceline and was pleased with the price. I'd noticed the reviews here for the most part all agreed about the quality of the rooms, but complaints when they came were directed at customer service and staff. We were pleased with the customer service and only a few minor points prevent me from giving our experience 5 stars.We arrived just barely after 3 p.m. (check in time), left our car parked out front in the 15 min unloading area, and proceeded to the reception area. There were about 3 or 4 people waiting in line ahead of us, but it moved rather quickly. Once up front, we were informed that our request (via email) had been honored as we were upgraded to a corner room, non-smoking, king size bed, on the 13th floor. However, the room was not ready just yet. I asked how long it would be, a call was made, but the answer was not clear right away. We were given 2 drink vouchers and told we could go to the bar and relax until the room was ready. So I complained none. We unloaded our bags to have them held for us until the room was ready, and I parked the car in the garage beneath the hotel ($19/day). By the time I got back (10 mins perhaps), our room was ready. We went ahead and used our free drink and let them hold the bags a little longer.The room was great, spacious, well-laid out, nice large bathroom. One note I didn't see explained anywhere, the TV volume is piped into the bathroom (kind of neat)- so there was a switch which said something about audio in the bathroom. It took me a couple of days to figure out what this was about, and I only did because I moved the TV a bit, and loosened the output cable, which somehow caused the TV audio not to work anywhere, as it was not completely detached. I couldn't figure it out right away and called to have someone come look at it. After about 30 minutes of waiting, I gave it another good look and figured it out (I didn't expect any audio out on this little TV, and saw no speakers anywhere that the audio would be going to)-- so I called and let them know I'd fixed it myself. Another negative note on the room, there is a thermostat, but as far as we could tell, it did nothing. It remained 72 degrees the entire time-- which is a comfortable temperature, but I'd like it just a bit cooler for sleeping (after the first night I slept without any covers). We tried turning it all the way down, and it did run all night, but apparently just put out more 72 degree air. After the first night and it had not cooled down, I made a call to have someone look at that. When we got back at the end of the day, a bottle of evian had been left for us, but the temperature remained the same (I guess the water was to keep us cool?). I decided it wasn't worth getting up in arms about, as like I said, it was quite comfortable so long as you didn't try to get under the covers. As far as this is concerned for the staff, a note of some sort would have been nice (or a voice message) to explain someone had looked at it, but they were unable to fix it because...Another positive on the customer service, we were pleasantly surprised by some chocolate covered strawberries arriving at our room on our first night there. These came with a note welcoming us to montreal. The concierge was helpful to a point, and gave us a recommendation (and made reservations) for a restaurant to celebrate our anniversary-- Bonaparte, which was quite good, albeit occupied almost entirely by Americans as far as we could tell. We later asked about a restaurant called Savannah which had a positive review in our guidebook. The concierge didn't have a menu for them (what we were actually looking for) and couldn't tell us any more. On Sunday we got to the location and realized it no longer existed-- perhaps why the concierge didn't have any idea about it.. I imagine a really exceptional concierge would have been able to tell us that with a little phone book/internet searching.I was just a tad annoyed about the garage situation-- I asked the bell hops about the costs, they knew it was $19/day, but didn't seem to know exactly how it worked (and if there was signage in the garage I missed it)-- they sort of told me that it really was unrelated to the hotel, effectively, but were saying the $19/day was based on some time of day, not on an actual 24 hr clock. i.e. if I parked Thursday at 4, and got my car out on Saturday at 3, thus being parked for a total of 47 hours, I might have been charged $57, rather than $38, due to being past some time. most other garages in the area charge something on the order of $3.50 for a half hour, or $14 up to 12 hours, or $17 for up to 24 hours (and as such seem to actually work on the 24 hr clock). In retrospect I'd recommend parking across the street in a $17/day garage, you unload your things at the curb anyway, and the walk from that garage is probably about the same as the one which is directly beneath the hotel. Of course, it's only $2 per day, so whatever. However it worked, i did park my car Thursday at 4, and took it out Sunday morning (meters don't charge on Sunday until 1 p.m.), and the total cost was $57. Ah, before I forget while I'm complaining about things, I was disappointed in glancing through the welcome packet of stuff on the desk to see that there were prices shown for toiletry items you forgot. This is my first trip to Canada so I have no idea if this is more of a different country kind of thing. It's along the same lines as the internet. Why is it I can stay at a cheap holiday inn which offers free wireless internet and will give me a toothbrush if I need it, but when you stay at a fancy 4* hotel, the internet is $20/day (I forget the actual cost) and a toothbrush will cost you $2.50? (I remembered my essentials, so it didn't really effect me, would have loved free wifi though)Oh, and another complaint (I don't believe in short reviews)-- on Saturday, my wife and I left our room at about 11:45 to meet friends for lunch. I'd gone downstairs to get something from my car earlier and passed a housekeeper who asked if she could clean our room yet (do not disturb sign was on)-- I told her no, but we'd be gone in an hour. We were only at lunch for an hour and a half or so, and then came back to the room with our friends for just a minute. Our room had not been touched at that point. After about 15 minutes our friends left and we walked them out. When we returned to our room, our dirty wine glasses from the night before had been removed, replaced with clean ones, nothing else done. We got ready to go back out and were gone another 10 minutes later and for the next several hours, coming back around 6:00, and still nothing different to our room. I should definitely point out we took the do not disturb off of our door when we left at 11:45. I'm not sure if the in and out was part of the problem, or if there is a time after which housekeeping will no longer do anything (but remember, they came in and gave us new wine glasses), but it seems there were definitely windows of opportunity there. We called before leaving for dinner and requested some fresh towels at least, which were provided. Really not a huge complaint, just one of those little things to keep it from being a perfect experience. The location of the hotel was quite good, and we walked to most things and took the metro to a couple others. Hopefully the complaints of the email won't outweigh the postiives-- as we were quite pleased with the experience and would definitely stay at this hotel again and recommend it to friends, but of course it's sometimes easier to harp on the little nagging things than rave about the good things. hope this helps others...\",\n",

We got a great deal on priceline for US$85 dollars a night. We had requested a room with two beds because my friend and I cannot sleep in the same bed (for reasons I wont mention in this review). When we checked in we were informed that the only available rooms had king size beds with only 1 bed per room and that if we wanted an extra cot to be brought to the room it would be $35 dollars per night. We were ok with having a cot brought in--I mean its a good compromise but we were NOT ok with being charged an additional $35 per night or with the nasty attitude the manager had. He repeated 3 or 4 times in the conversation that there was nothing he could do about the extra charge because we booked on priceline. It just reinfored the double standard they use for treating guests who have discounted room rates versus guests who pay full price. I would certainly never return to this hotel.-Dina K, New York, NY',\n",

Internet was an additional $14.50 a day (which I did not know before I had booked this hotel), and I was not able to get logged in successfully. I found room service to be quite overpriced and not a good value either.Because of the feeling that this hotel was overpriced for what I required, I called the travel agent to move me to another hotel.

There was a safe in one of the nightstands. The closet was large w/plenty of hangers. The large bath had a separate shower and large vanity and adjacent shelf so there was plenty of room for our toiletries. Towels and linens were high quality.

Our room was beautiful; we had a corner room with a good view of the city. There are no rooms below the 10th floor, so everyone gets a great view. My wife found the bed very comfortable, although I found it a bit stiff. The restaurants found in this hotel are very expensive, although lower cost dining options are within a few minutes walk. There is a great breakfast restaurant called Nouveau Notre Dame on Rue Notre Dame (you can have two full breakfasts for under 10 CAD). The only frustrating thing about this hotel is the fact it has a very small pool and lacks a whirlpool. The swimming pool is designed exclusively for lap swimming and should just be considered part of the gym, not somewhere to relax. My wife and I do look forward to visiting this hotel again to &quot;relive&quot; our honeymoon.',\n",
       " \"We just spent for four nights and were quite pleased.I received the hotel in response to Priceline bid, but we were never treated with anything less than first class service and attention.The check in staff were friendly and helpful, actually switching me to a different room to allow a slightly early check in. Our 19th floor room was large and comfortable with an excellent view of the river and parts of Old Montreal.There is an attached mall (closes early however) with a food court and restaurants. It's a short walk to the Notre Dame and basically anything in the old port. Towards downtown, it's a bit uphill, but walkable to St Catherine's Street and much shopping and entertainment. We found that much of what we wanted to see was very close and walkable from the hotel.For the more distant sites, we booked a Grey Line Tour through the concierge and visited the Olympic Stadium, Botanical Gardens and the Mont Royal in a single day.The hotel was an excellent value, great location and friendly staffed. I would return anytime.\",\n",
       " 'We spent one night at the Intercontinental in Montreal on our way to Quebec City from Toronto and at $155CAD per night, we were pleased (until we found out other travelers paid half as much!) Regardless of the room rate, we found the room to be quite spacious, big enough for a king sized bed, sofa, armoire, and desk. We had a view of the hole next door where the new Westin is being built, but thankfully we couldnt tell you if any construction went on during our stay because it was blissfully quiet. The bed was on the softer side (not the best support for two people with back problems), the linens were soft and the down comforter fluffy and light. The poorly-lit bathroom was also large, with a separate shower stall and bathtub. The grout in the corners of the bathroom probably could have used a good scrubbing and the showerhead needed to be decalcified as the spray was a little wild; the temperature and pressure was great though. The hotel was conveniently within walking distance to St. Catherine, and across the street from Toque where we had dinner (highly recommended).',\n",
       " 'We got this room through Priceline for $100. It was an amazing room on the 23rd floor with a view of the Notre Dame Cathedral, Port and Champlain Bridge. Service was great, from check-in, to room service, to check-out and the bell/valet. It was a very pleasant stay, and I would DEFINATELY stay here again, and even be willing to pay full price ;-)',\n",
       " 'I booked this hotel through priceline.com and was pleasantly surprised by the $85US rate that was accepted by this hotel. I had not stayed here before, and given my experience, I would both recommend it and return on a future visit. It is conveniently located close to Old Montreal. We walked to Notre Dame and the waterfront. My Wife and I went with two friends for the Just for Laughs Festival, and this was an ideal place for us to be. The rooms were spacious, clean with enormous bathrooms with both a tub and separate enclosed shower. All the amenities were provided and the bed was very comfortable. Linens and pillows were better than average. The only small quip would be the small tv, however we were not in Montreal to watch tv in our room. We had a very helpful concierge (Valery), who recommended a very good bistro not far away for dinner (Holder) which we enjoyed. Having read reviews previously, I parked across the street rather than at the hotel. Not sure if it saved any money at $14 a night there as opposed to the hotel. We walked to the very good Eggs-spectations for breakfast just two blocks away. Our friends had one bad experience of their room being left alone by housekeeping until the late afternoon, when we had returned from walking around and they were stuck without being able to relax. That was a disappointment but not for our room. Housekeeping staff should complete their task long before check-in time around 3PM you would think. Otherwise a hotel that I recommend. Enjoy your travels to Montreal!!',\n",
       " \"We stayed here from July 4th to 7th. Our standard room was spacious, more than comfortable and clean. It wasn't quite luxurious but it had a wonderful bed in a nice, updated and neutral decor.The bathroom was fine - lots of hot water and decent pressure.The location was very convenient - it connects to the metro and is only a couple of blocks from Old Montreal.There is shopping underground in the attached Montreal Trade Center - and a nice coffee shop that my husband got coffee, pastries, and yogurt from for our breakfast (beats room service!)We fould the concierge very helpful - they got us tickets to museum exhibits as well as a soccer game. One male concierge gave us incorrect instructions on which metro stop to use when finding Schwartz's deli. We ended up walking 15 blocks when we were already kind of beat but that seems a very minor complaint.\",\n",
       " \"We stayed at the InterContinental Montreal for 3 nights. The trip was for both business and pleasure. We booked through Priceline and ended up with one of the really inexpensive rates. They are one of the hotels who still takes your Priority number and gives you credit for the stay...even if you book through Priceline, Expedia, etc. I always appreciate that.We arrived very late on a Friday night. My boyfriend had requested a room on a high floor. They originally had us booked into a room on the 11th floor, but the front desk was very accommodating and moved us to 1708. It is a corner room with views of the river and the city. The floor to ceiling window on the main wall is lovely. We looked at both rooms and I must say that the corner rooms are much larger than the traditional rooms and if you can get one---do! The corner rooms have a small sofa that the other rooms don't have.Big note: On the side of the building where you have rooms 1-10...there is a GIANT construction project going on. They are building a W hotel next door. During our stay it was a big hole in the ground with giant crains moving metal poles. On both Saturday and Sunday there was ZERO noise from the site. They were doing small projects, but we did not hear them. I would certainly take note of staying on that side during the week.As previously reviewed, the bathrooms are very spacious. The towels, bathrobes and slippers are very nice. The toiletries provided were of a nice quality. They offer shampoo (no conditioner), soap gel and body lotion. There is an additional box with cotton bads, hair bands, shoe polisher, etc.The decor is typical of the traditional style you would find at most Intercontinentals. The views are very nice and the curtains are the really good kind of black out curtains. You could sleep all day and never know the sun was out. :)The TV is small and you have to work at swiveling it to face the bed. Keep trying...it does turn all the way to face the bed...it just takes some effort. They do have several English stations, including the major US networks out of Plattsburgh, NY. NOTE: It took us a while to find the in-room safe. It is in the nightstand. It is free of charge and big enough to store a laptop.The mini-bar is well stocked, but outrageously overpriced...even for a nice hotel. I travel a lot and it was most expensive I have seen. Example, $27 for a 1/2 bottle of red wine (a brand that normally costs $11-12 dollars for a full bottle in the U.S.) This is coming from someone who usually uses the mini-bar. The hotel does not have a gift shop in it. There is a convenience store two short blocks away that has everything and is easily accessible with extended hours. The beds are on the soft side, but comfortable. The only thing we found odd was the mattress pad, it had plastic on one side...so it sounds like you are sleeping on garbage bags. It is easily removed if this bothers you.The valet was pleasant, speedy and helpful. There did appear to be many parking lots in the area, that offered cheaper rates. They are a short walk from the hotel. The area seemed quite safe even late at night. We found the concierge to be extremely helpful. They indulged us with many restaurant ideas. A great plus it that they have a full book of all of the local menus. Their maps and directions were terrific. I know many people said they were unhappy with the customer service, but I must say that this was not our experience. From the valet, to the front desk to the concierge...everyone was very helpful.The best part about the hotel is the location. It is a short walk from Old Montreal. There are many really great restaurants within walking distance. Everyone talks about Eggspectation that is around the block. The name might be corny, but the breakfast is really good and it is a cute restaurant.It is a 20-30 minute cab ride to the airport. The flat rate is $35.00. There are plenty of cabs in front of the hotel from early in the morning until late in the evening.\",\n",
       " \"Won a three night stay at this hotel with a bid of $80 USD. The best thing about this hotel is its proximity to Old Montreal. It's a very short walk to the heart of OM. The rooms are what you would expect from a 4* hotel. On my next visit I will avoid the valet parking as there is plenty of parking nearby for much less than the valet rate.All in all it's a great hotel and the PL rate provided a steal of a deal! I would stay here again.\",\n",
       " 'I totally agree with the former reviewer that the Intercontinental staff are rude and aloof. They have no concept of customer service. Last time we stayed there we had numerous errors on our bill and only returned because of the good access to old Montreal. After one night we decided to switch to the Sofitel where the staff were delightful!',\n",
       " \"Any hotel that would charge business travellers $14/day for internet doesn't deserve our business. They also charged us for mini-bar we didn't use\",\n",
       " \"I spend a lot of time in Montreal on business for stay of a few nights to over 2 weeks. I've logged time at many different Montreal hotels and the Intercontinental is a solid choice for business travelers. The rooms are a decent size as are the baths, but like a number of Montreal hotels, staff is the weak spot. I didn't find them rude so much as indifferent. No cheerful offers of help. No professional attitude. Just sort of, 'It's a job and I'll do it if I have to.' And they are very short on bell staff, so be prepared to manage your own bags. You'll need to go up an escalator to the lobby and reception desk as the hotel occupies the top floors of an office building.I took a large corner room and when the first didn't suit the front desk willingly changed my room. Room service was exceptionally expensive, but good and arrived hot, and the bar and restaurant both had good food, far better than the usual hotel fare in Montreal. Dinner in the main restaurant was around $100/pp with one glass of wine. Breakfast was good but service then was rather haphazard. Bar service was prompt and the drinks good. The limited lunch menu was good and food hot and served promptly. Phone calls using a pre-paid calling card still resulted in a charge. What is it with hotels and all these stupid little add on charges? It's a very annoying trend.The bed slept hot. The work desk was uncomfortable, but with wi-fi I was able to work on the loveseat. The TV was not the 25&quot; indicated, but a little 19&quot; model at least 15 years old.Bathroom was large, but the shower stall really tiny. It had a separate heating system. The room thermostat was more decorative than useful. The location is really good in summer months when getting into Old Montreal would be easy, but I was there when a snow storm hit and walking around was a pain. The hotel does sit on a subway stop, but I took a taxi up to St Cathrine's to wander the main shopping area $6-8 each way. The mall adjacent to the hotel operates during business hours Monday to Friday, except for a large clothing store everything was closed by 6PM. There's no place to buy soda or water or any little stuff you may have forgotten once the little drug store closes as the Intercontinental has no 'gift shop' like most hotels.Not Montreal's best, but a solid entry with good rooms well done for business travelers looking for a 4* level hotel. Better than the Sheraton or Marriott Chateau Champlain [Marriott has better service but small rooms]. Weekend visitors - maid service on weekends is LATE [looked to be about half staff] in the day, so be prepared.\",\n",
       " \"I stayed last weekend at the Intercontinental and had a wonderful time! As to other people's comments, the staff was very pleasant and nothing extra was charged to my credit card in error. The room was very large and bathroom was completely luxorious!! (It was almost the same size as my studio apartment in NYC!) My boyfriend also took advantage of the indoor pool which was very nice as well. The location of the hotel is great for sight seeing in old Montreal - it was about a block away from the Notre Dame and not that far from the main shopping area. Overall, it was a great experience and I would recommend to all! +++\",\n",
       " 'I am a regular traveller to Montreal and found the Intercontinental Hotel to be tired and the staff totally unprofessional and lacking in basic customer service skills. Also make sure you check your bill. When I stayed there with other business associates we all had errors in our bills which the staff disputed and charged to our credit cards after check-out. There are plenty of other options in the city.',\n",
       " \"We recently stayed at the Intercontinental on a cold Montreal weekend. However, the hotel provided us with a warm and cozy experience. Based upon some recent comments (and a previous stay there) we were prepared for a nice hotel and bad service. We were wrong on the latter. The staff was warm, gracious and efficient. Check-in and check out took about 5 minutes in total. Our requests for a room with a king-size bed and non-smoking were honored. The room was spacious and the bathroom was immaculate and plush. The bed was extremely comfortable. The bar area was fun with good drinks and reasonable prices. Although we did not eat at the hotel, we were offered a coupon for a 10% discount at dinner. The proximity to Old Montreal is great; less than 10 minutes to St. Paul Street. Even the walk to the main shopping areas on Crescent Street took less than 30 minutes, and with all the new underground connections you don't even have to go outside until you get there. And, the Metro is accessible from the shopping mall that is adjacent to the hotel. These are nice touches on those cold Montreal days. Based upon our stay at the Intercontinental, we will look for their specials for our future trips to Montreal. It appears that the management of the Intercontinental heard the complaints about service and decided to take them seriously. We had a wonderful stay.\",\n",
       " \"I was hesitant about staying here after reading some of the negative reviews, but was pleasantly surprised upon arrival. I stayed there for a week for a conference, and enjoyed every minute of my stay there. The room was nicely decorated and the bed was comfortable. The bathroom was almost as large as the bedroom and very luxurious. The major complaint that the staff was rude was not to be seen - they were very helpful and accomodating. The bar staff were very kind with directions and suggestions on places to see and eat at. Veronica was especially helpful. The main restaurant was, as reported elsewhere, expensive, but the food was worth it. It's a great hotel in a great area. After staying in many hotels throughout the world, this one is definitely in my top three, and I would stay there again without hesitation.\",\n",
       " 'The Intercontinental is located at the edge of Old Montreal on a road which is easily accessible from expressways. It is a short walk to Old Montreal, but you are not in the middle of all the noise and commotion that you get on weekends. Hotel is nicely furnished, with excellent rooms. Food is excellent, Sunday brunch is very nice. You can generally get a good nightly rate. Parking is pricey, but you could use another garage nearby if you wish.',\n",
       " \"I booked the Intercontinental on Priceline for $70 USD per night, which is a steal given the location and lovely accomodations. If you prefer staying adjacent to Rue Saint Catherine or Rue Crescent, then a more downtown hotel might be preferable. Walking to the above streets takes approximately 15-20 minutes, while Vieux Montreal (old montreal) is a meager 5 minutes. Upon arrival, the valet ($26 CAD/night) was efficient and he sent our bags up to the room while we checked in. The check-in was a bit slow, but conducted in a friendly enough manner. The concierge was able to recommend a few nice restaurants in Vieux Montreal and she took the time to give us directions and a map. The room service was very quick, both for a late-night snack and for cafe au lait in the morning. The TV was programmed with a great deal of english speaking stations, which was a nice surprise--pay per view movies are $14.99 CAD. 24 hours of internet access (either via hookup or through the TV) is $13.99 CAD. We had a Deluxe room which I suspect is a bit larger than a standard, and came with all of the expected amenities, including a safe, mini-bar, coffee maker, hairdryer, robes, etc. The bathroom was VERY spacious, even by american standards, and done entirely in marble. I also liked the seperate shower and bathtub. The room itself was pristine (I am extremely critical regarding cleanliness of hotel rooms), and the bed linens were crisp and comfortable. The mattress itself was rather firm, but was covered in a featherbed, which was a nice touch. While we dined mostly outside of the hotel, we did have one meal at the hotel bar/piano lounge, Le Cristallin. The bartender was gracious, and the food was surprisingly delicious, with an elegant presentation. As a side note, our favorite dinner occurred in Vieux Montreal at Mondavie, a restaurant with live jazz and an extensive wine cellar. They offered a Table d'Hote 3 course prix fixe meal that was to die for at $30 CAD---highly recommend! A cab ride to the Casino Montreal costs roughly $15 CAD and the Casino should not be missed! It is non-smoking and is elegant....I had a fantastic time, despite being a non-gambler and normally disliking casinos. In conclusion, I would certainly return to the Intercontinental and would encourage others to stay, especially for a discounted rate.\",\n",
       " \"I stayed at the InterContinental two nights to participate in a marathon in Montreal. The location is in the business center and around the corner from the W. Down the hill from the main shopping/nightlife strip. The hotel is adjacent/connected to a mini indoor mall (closed on weekends) and Metro station. I liked the accomodations including the lobby, and spacious rooms (excellent size bathroom). My room was corner room and only defect was a burnt out bulb in the bathromo - it was an otherwise perfect room. Bed/mattress was extremely comfortable.Some things I dislike - charge for Internet access (average for 4* hotels) and the staff. The front desk did not have urgency while seeing customers wait online, and concierge was simply awful! I waited 5-10 minutes while a conceierge women was on the phone and walked away. Later a different gentleman couldn't find a roadmap to assist me with directions. If they could improve some of their staff - I would say this is an EXCELLENT location but I'd rather stay at a few other hotels in Montreal because they seem to care about their guest.\",\n",
       " 'We stayed at this hotel during the recent Thanksgiving weekend (11/22--11/25/06). We selected this hotel because of its walking convenience to the old city (about 5 minutes) as well as to the downtown shopping district (about 15 minutes). It was also easy to find for someone not familiar with this city. The hotel room was nicely furnished, clean, quiet, and the king sized bed was quite comfortable. The desk service was prompt but not overly friendly, while the concierge was quite helpful regarding directions and planning. The parking garage was under the hotel, and you can park your own car there and save the valet fee. Directly connected to the hotel is a small covered shopping and office area with a bureau de change and some small restaurants, one of which had excellent coffee and pastry for a quick breakfast. We would definitely choose this hotel again when we return to Monreal.',\n",
       " \"Intercontinental is the top hotel brand in the hotel company that includes the Holiday Inn Chain. I would expect the level of service to be at the same level of the other top hotel brands in other chains -- Ritz Carlton, St Regis, Conrad. I found the service at this hotel below that level. It started when I arrived and there was nobody out front to assist with the car and the luggage. This is a hotel in an urban location with nowhere immediately in front to leave the car for any length of time.. especially considering that the front desk for the hotel is not just inside the door, but up on the second floor. I had to go inside the hotel to find someone to assist me. Once I had checked in and gone to my room, it took over a half hour for my luggage to arrive in my room. Later in my stay I took postcards down to the front desk to be mailed. Instead of the front desk clerk (who was not busy at the time) just taking them and seeing they got to the right place, told me i had to go across the lobby and ring the bell at the conceirge desk and wait for her to help me. It's a little thing, but making the guest do all of the work, is not providing good customer service in any business -- certianly not one at this level. Service at breakfast in the restaurant was very sad. Normally, I don't do breakfast buffets, but it was included in the package at the rate I booked. So put the coupon on the table and went to serve myself. There appeared to be an omlette station set up but nobody was staffing it during the entire time i was in the restaurant. I returned to the table and still there was no sign of the server. I had been seated at a table with my back to the entire restaurant so it wasn't easy to spot a server...which actually isn't my job, it's the server's job to spot me. The server appeared at my table only once and that was to ask if I wanted coffee. When I told her &quot;no thanks&quot; i never saw her again. I got tired of waiting for her to bring me a check, so I just left the breakfast coupon on the table and left. Although I had complimentary breakfast the rest of my stay I did not return.Service at Dinner in the restaurant was the only bright spot at this hotel. Both nights I was waited on by Jean-Francois who was very knowledgeable and attentive. He has been a server there for 15 years and made for two very enjoyable dinners. Dinner hit all the right service points from the amuse bouche all the way through to the little mini creme brulee with the check. All of the dishes I ordered tasted great and had nice presentations. The building has a small footprint and is connected to other buildings by a tall thin atrium. Rooms are all above the 10th floor. My room was on the 22nd floor and although it was immediately off the elevator area, I never heard the elevators &quot;ping&quot; nor did I hear any activity in the hallway.My room (2204) was nicely appointed and had a large window with a nice view of eastern Montreal and a partial view of the river. The bathroom had a separate corner shower and a tub as well. The bed was very comfortable and the bath had very large soft towels. I didn't see anything wrong with my room except that the desk faced the wall putting my back to the room and the view out the window. I move desks around a lot in hotel rooms to I can work on the computer and not stare at the wall. It's a very nice hotel in a good location but for a hotel of their class and room rate, they need to polish up their service skills of their associates.\",\n",
       " 'We went to Montreal for a quick one night get-away without the kids. The reception desk performance was sub-par. I had to wait and listen to four representatives argue with an unhappy customer for about 10 minutes. During check out the staff was overwhelmed with six customers and I left after 10 minutes with no movement in the line. The hotel is in a great location, we walked to great restaurants and attractions. The room was small but comfortable with a great view. The dry bar items for sale had an opened and eaten item that had must have been missed by the maid. The bed was very comfortable. The bathroom was nicely laid out and furnished, however, mold and mildewed grout (black spots) in the shower and a cracked sink are unacceptable. We will try another hotel next time',\n",

What a great hotel! Rooms are lovely and large and especially quiet. By calling the hotel, we received a special package, including a high-floor room with view and full American breakfast buffet for $30 CAD less than the Vogue.It is true the Vogue is charming, but if you want it all -- service, location, and quiet, the Intercontinental is the way to go!We would stay there again!',\n",
       " \"I recently spent 3 nights at the InterContinental Montreal over Columbus Day/Canadian Thanksgiving Week-End and I was very inpressed for the price ($140CA-AAA Rate) The locate is perfect to explore Old Montreal. It is in the Financial District, so it is quiet on the week-end. It's a minor walk to St Catherine's St. as well. The elevators are super fast. The rooms are very upscale with Crown Molding, but the bathroom is superb. Seperate bath and shower. My wife loved that. We had a great city view with the park below. The hotel is so quiet. You will not have trouble sleeping, but you will need to enjoy feather beds, duvet and pillows. We had a mini party in our roon, but you could not hear us at all in the hall. The front desk staff was very nice and helpful. The lap pool is very nice, but there was a bunch of construction stuff on the outdoor deck. I believe they were doing some work to the hotel.My only draw back is that the maid did not vaccum for the 3 days were were there. The bath and beds were well taken care of, but I like a nice clean carpet ever day. Not sure if I would say 5 Star, but 4 and a half. This was our 10th trip to Montreal and we will be back to the IC for sure.\",\n",
       " \"I stayed at the Intercontinental for a week at the end of September 2006 while attending a conference at the Palais De Congress (Across the street). I have a mixed review of this hotel. The room, facility, healthclub were all very nice. My reservation about this hotel was in regards to my 'reservation.' I had called to make the reservation months ahead of time. There was a conference rate and it was reasonable. I reserved a NON-SMOKING room. Upon arriving around 10:30 pm the night of my reservation, I was given room 2020. Twentieth floor, nice view, nice amenities. But, it was a smoking room and reeked of stale cigarettes. Upon returning to the desk to ask for a room change, I was bruskly told...&quot;We are fully booked tonight and we do not garuntee non-smoking rooms.&quot; WHAT?!?! What was the point of making a reservation months in advance?!?! I was given no sympathy and no options other than changing rooms the next morning. They offered to open a window for me. That's all. As it was late and I figured all the area hotels were booked because of the conference I was attending, I stayed in that room for the night. Nothing like having stale smoke in your bed when you lay your head down at night and in the morning I reeked. When I went down the next morning, the new desk staff were not eager to change my room. I had to insist. They offered no amends for the error. When I got a new room on a non-smoking floor it was nice and I was fine with it, and the housekeeping service. But be aware that the front desk and concierge staff are a cold bunch.\",\n",

       " \"The InterContinental hotel is a nice place to stay, with a great location, especially if you are attending a meeting at the convention center (which is right across the street). The room my husband and I had was spacious, with a nice, comfy bed. The bathroom was also spacious, with a separate shower and bath. Robes were provided, which is always a plus. The staff were friendly enough, we had no problems there. The food was average, but overpriced. The reason I think this hotel does not live up to it's 5 star rating is that they charge for every extra (tea in the room, internet access). The pool is very small, but the remainder of the spa amenities (including the massage and sauna) were nice. Overall, I would stay here again, but wouldn't pay full price. Try to find a deal (check Montreal's official tourism website or Priceline).\",\n",
       " 'I stayed here for 6 nights at the end of August, and enjoyed my stay. I had a great rate on Priceline -- $90 a night, with the usual fees etc. bringing it up to about $100. The room -- 1804 -- appeared to be one of the smaller rooms on the floor, but it was fine for me. Very nice view to the southeast, the river and the island and hills on the horizon. The bed was enormous and very comfortable, there was a good desk space, and the armchair was one of the best I have ever sat in. The bathroom is large and well laid out, with good quality toiletries -- The White Company, London, and Green Tea. The cleaning staff are terrific. I especially appreciated having the room made up before I returned early in the afternoon for a nap each day. There are two high speed cable internet options -- a daily rate of $14.95 and a weekly rate of $75.00 for unlimited use. I chose the latter. The connecting cord snakes through the lamp on the desk, along with a telephone connection in case you want to use a telephone modem, though with hotel phone rates what they are, I cannot imagine anyone with a modern computer wanting to do that. Two small downsides, neither major. 1) There was no room ready when I arrived at around 11:30 am, and so left the luggage with the bellmen at the entrance. The woman at the reception desk was efficient but not very friendly. But I returned when she suggested and got the room I was so happy with, and she warmed up as the week went on. 2) I had a drink and a not very interesting pasta light meal in the bar off the lobby, which were predictably overpriced. I would not recommend the food there.The comments of other posters about location are true. The metro stations are a bit of a hike, but not a problem. The Metro has a 3 day pass for 17$, well worth it. There is a weekly pass, but it runs from Monday to Sunday and is not date-flexible, for just a little bit more. I got it for the second half of my stay and gave it to a friend when I left. The &quot;underground city&quot; tunnels are accessible without going outside, which I imagine would be helpful in the wintertime. I did not have the hotel breakfast, but then I almost never do anywhere. Eggspectations is as good as everyone says it is.Restaurant recommendation: Brunoise, 3807 St.-Andre. Terrific nouvelle-style cuisine, very inventive mixture of flavors.I would heartily recommend this hotel to anyone if you can get a good price.',\n",
       " \"Spent three nights at this hotel over the 2006 Labour Day weekend at a great rate from Priceline. Hotel was well appointed, clean and equipped with all the modern conveniences. The bathroom was especially nice, with a separate shower stall and bathtub. King size bed sported a a very nice duvet but was somewhat lumpy and uncomfortable to sleep in. Interesting location in Montreal's recently redeveloped financial district. However, the hotel is not particularly convenient to Montreal's attractions unless you have business at the convention centre or will be spending your entire visit in Old Montreal. Staff was very friendly and attentive. The hotel sits adjoined with some older buildings, connected by a spectacular glass atrium within which stands a peice of the Berlin Wall. A good find if you can get a good price. I find Montreal lacks quality hotels in the mid-range, as most of the city's choices are either very high end, or old and somewhat run down, so this was a refreshing change.\",\n",
       " \"This was our third time in Montreal and our first time at the Intercontinental. It was a very nice hotel. Check-in was easy and it was easy to find. We valet parked our car to the tune of $26 a day, but that was easy and efficient.We were on the 22 floor and our room was bigger than average. The bed was great and the bathroom had a stand-up shower and a bathtub.I didn't eat at the restaurant. I did have drinks at the lobby bar and a bar called Chez Plume by the conference rooms. Both were comfortable places and excellent service.Previous posters had talked about the breakfast being too expensive in the hotel. I wouldn't eat breakfast at four-star hotel and there are some alternatives very close by. One is a little counter in the &quot;courtyard&quot; connected to the hotel on the bottom floor. It looks similar to a food court. You can get bagels and coffee. Another place on the way to Old Montreal is Eggspectations, which is a great place to get breakfast. Also previous posters seem to disagree on if this hotel is in a good location. In my opinion, it is easy to get to Old Montreal, but not so easy to get to the nightlife at Catherine and Crescent. It is close to two metro stops so that really helps to get around. But dont expect to walk out your hotel and find bars and the nightlife right out your door (its a couple of blocks over).I would also be remiss if I didnt mention the coolest fountain across from the hotel. It incorporates fire at certain times during the evening. Great fun!\",\n",
       " \"I was out there on business. I had a great 3 night stay, no complaints. Nice, clean work-out facility, big bathroom with shower stall and bath-tub. Most comfortable King size bed I'd slept in. There wasn't a great view from the window, but wasn't there for the view. It was in walking distance to downtown, shopping places, etc..And if your into famous rock stars, it is located right next too St. James Hotel which is known to have celbs stay there. We actually saw Mariah Carey when we were there; she was playing a concert in Montreal. I'd def. stay there again.\",\n",
       " \"Very much enjoyed my stay at the Intercontinental. First off, the immediate surroundings are quiet (so you'll get a good night's sleep), but it's a nice part of town, close to the Old City and Downtown, a Metro station, &amp; good restaurants, not to mention that the lobby of the RBC building right behind it (conveniently housing a late-night ATM) is a sight to behold in its own right. We didn't use any special services the hotel had on offer, such as the concierge, bellhop, restaurant, etc, though service overall was friendly and accomodating. Do watch out for the incidental; they're plentiful. Local phone calls were a $1.50 each, which was something new to me. The exercise room and pool were mediocre. The bathroom was, however, nice and big, all marble inside with a separate shower and tub, and the beds were extraordinarily comfortable. Although it's apparent the hotel hasn't been recently redone (usually something I usually go for), the overall quality of the building and furniture were a few notches above the norm. Impeccably clean throughout--highly recommended\",\n",
       " 'We stayed at the Intercontential for two nights in late July.  Pros: Great location, easy access to the Metro, and a pleasant walk into the heart of old Montreal. Our hotel package included breakfast both days and it was a delicious buffet wtih an attentive service staff. The 10th floor pool with patio was a nice spot to catch the late afternoon sun. Room accommodations were lovely. Seemed that business and family travelers intermingled easily.Cons: The concierge seemed a bit swamped at times but with patience you could get some good tips on dining and sightseeing.Without a doubt, we would stay here again.',\n",
       " \"The hotel is nice looking but upon arrival the bell service did not offer to take our bags and we were told our room would not be ready for 2 1/2 hours. We were then told we could carry our bags down to the bell service station to check them until we were able to check in. When we went back to chek in the desk was very understaffed (as it was every day we were there) and they apparently lost our papers for the room we 'checked in to' earlier. This second process took us about 25 minutes. When we got to our room it was an average looking room. The best thing was the location. Staying in Old Montreal is perfect.\",\n",
       " \"My partner and I stayed at this hotel for 9 nights at the end of July and beginning of August of 2006. This was a great room with lots of extra space on the 24th floor and a small sofa, good sized desk , tall ceilings and comfy lounging chair. One of the best sized rooms I've stayed in Montreal. The decor was nice, not as stylish as say a W or the Le St Germain, but consistent. We were on a club room floor and the breakfast, though just continental, was a nice treat given the high exchange rate and saved us prob $20/ day for breakfast. The afternoon snack was also a nice touch. The towels are big and soft and the bed though a tad soft was very comfy. The location is excellent, you can get to all parts of the city and Old Montreal is right out the back door - it might take a 5minute walk to get to the area by the Basillca, and ten to the plaza but it is quick. The Victoria metro stop is right attached tot he hotel via the enclosed atrium or just a short walk outside. Popressa one block away is a quick little healthy/inexpensive make your own pasta dish place. Major complaints were an odd odor in the Lobby, like someone had used a drity mop to clean the floor, odors in the hallways near our room(not enough to deter another stay), and the snacks at the afternoon snack time went very quickly and it took one guest to get the manager up here to keep it replenished with cheeses and crackers until 7:30pm..All in all I would have been nice if the club room was open all day cosidering how much of an upcharge the do for the room. But considering that at the time, other hotels I had stayed at were charging anywhere from $60-100/more per night. We thought it was a great choice.\",\n",
       " \"My husband and I stayed at this hotel for a last-minute romantic getaway and we were very pleased. The service at this hotel is excellent. All of the hotel staff, including the reception desk, concierge, housekeeping, bartenders, waiters, and doormen were very friendly, pleasant, and polite. Everyone greets you with a smile and a bonjour! when you walk by. Catherine at the concierge desk helped us plan our daily activities by making recommendations and booking reservations for us. She always had a smile on her face. We don't know what we would have done without her!!! We booked a standard room with a king size bed. The room was extremely comfortable and a lot larger than we expected. It had a small foyer area and closet when you walk in, so you don't walk right into the bed like you do at most hotels. We had a small sitting area with a chaise lounge and a big, comfy chair in front of the armoire that housed the TV. There was also a desk and chair for business travelers, a bench in front of the bed, and 3 phones (one on each side of the bed and the third in the bathroom). The bathroom had marble flooring and countertop. The bed and pillows were VERY comfortable.The hotel is conveniently located in Old Montreal and is within blocks of the main attractions (Notre-Dame Basilica, Old Port, Crescent Street and downtown).We highly recommend this hotel to anyone planning to visit Montreal. This is definitely where we will stay the next time were in town.\",\n",
       " 'Stayed here for 3 nights in July, 2006. The location is fine, not anything more than office buildings outside the door, area was deserted at night but felt safe. A 5-10 minute walk takes you to the old city or St. Catherine St. where you have the typical tourist selections. Taxi layover is right in front of hotel. Check in was quick, there was only one clerk working and was checking someone in. I was the only person waiting, but when a second person walked up the clerk immediately called someone else over to help. I had a &quot;deluxe&quot; room, no view but large, clean and fully stocked with all the requisites, coffee maker, iron etc. The bathroom was large with marble tiles and plenty of towels, even a speaker so you could hear the TV. The concierge was available from 7 am-11pm. Airconditioning was fine and the room was quiet even though the room next to me was occupied with a young child. Make sure you check out the fountain in front of the hotel. There is actually a ring of fire in the fountain that goes off at night. Check the description of the fountain at the northwest edge of the park, if you see the French description walk around to the other side of the pole for English which includes the times the ring of fire appears.All in all, a great experience.',\n",
       " \"This place is excellent! I am well travelled and this Intercontinental really impressed me. Certainly not the cheapest hotel in town, but a bargain for the quality of the room and the service. Everyone here has an excellent attitude. Very good gym, pool, two restaurants and a bar. Little park right out front. On the edge of Old Montreal but with the Square Victoria merto stop connected directly to the hotel through a shopping arcade (very handy in winter, I'd guess). Only negative: very small lobby. No biggie for me. This place is superb--better than many a Ritz Carlton I've stayed at--and not nearly as expensive. You can't go wrong here.\",\n",
       " \"Very nice hotel on the edge of Old Montreal. Public spaces are attractive and tastefully done, and rooms were probably a touch nicer than the standard business hotel in the area. Comfy beds, large bathrooms, and nice fixtures throughout the room. Shower pressure was surprisingly erratic. However, I've found many other Montreal hotels to be slightly dingy, and didn't feel that way about this hotel at all - it was very clean, and everything felt new and modern.Higher floors seem to be the &quot;deluxe&quot; rooms, while the lower floors seem to be the &quot;superior&quot; - other than the view, there's no apparent difference between them. My first room - a lower-floor superior - had an awful view and smelled like smoke. My second room - a deluxe on a higher floor - had a wonderful view of the river. The view is worth the extra $$.The hotel is also connected to an attractive indoor mall / shopping area that seems to be shared by adjacent buildings. However, it seems to be shut down on the weekends, or at least it seemed like it when I was there.Note that this hotel isn't in the heart of Old Montreal, like a few other of the hotels may be. It's on the outskirts, and is really in what's now being called the &quot;International District&quot;. It's not a far walk, but if you're looking to walk out of your hotel into the heart of the old city, this isn't it. I received a rate of $189 for a Thursday night and $135 for a Friday - both in CAD. That's a pretty remarkable rate given the competition's prices and the quality of the hotel. On balance, next time I'm in the area, I'd certainly stay here again, and do recommend it.\",\n",
       " 'Stayed in one of their business rooms. very spaciuos and comfortable has hispeed internet at $14CAD per 24hrs. Bed above average and comfortable. staff friendly and helpful. Taxi fare from Trudeu airport $35CAD.Shopping area about 15min walk away, located nearer the old town though. Definatley stay again.',\n",
       " \"I stayed at the Intercontinental Montreal from May 13th - 17th, 2006. This was my first trip to Montreal (I was in town for a convention which took place at the convention centre across the street, Palais des Congres de Montreal).I thought this hotel was very nice. Perhaps a bit pretentious but you tend to get that with a high end hotel. The staff were extremely friendly, the restaurant was quite good, my room was very nice (my bed was incredible...I slept very well during my stay!). The piano bar/lounge in the hotel was also quite good. Be sure to try an appletini...it was delicious!Definitely check out Old Montreal, especially the Notre Dame Basilica. It really is incredible! I found Montrealers to be very friendly. I had been concerned that I'd have some difficulties in Montreal as I don't speak French but thankfully everyone that I met was very gracious and switched to English as soon as they realized I was struggling to understand! Being in Montreal truly has a unique feel to it...very unlike the rest of Canada. Montreal is a great place to visit if you want to feel as if you've left Canada without having to travel very far.If attending a convention at the Palais des Congres de Montreal, the location of the Intercontinental is perfect! The hotel is beautiful and I would highly recommend staying there.\",\n",
       " \"I stayed at this hotel April 29-May 5 and had a great experience. I was attending a conference across the street so it was conveniently located and had access to the underground at the back of the hotel which was especially good when it rained. It's on the fringe of Old Montreal which was another plus. The hotel staff, including the concerige were very pleasant and helpful. I was upgraded upon check in and had a room on the 16th floor. The room was large as was the bathroom, although the shower stall was tiny. The bed was extremely comfortable, nice linens, lots of pillows. Bathrobes were provided and the toiletries were plentiful. It was nice to know that the front desk would do a currency exchange without charging extra. The bar off the lobby was very comfortable. I ordered a specialty coffee drink that they were unfamiliar with but they were willing to try it and it turned out better than I've had before. There is a pub restaurant across the back walkway that is part of the hotel and is very good too. This hotel is part of the Montreal World Trade Center complex which is accessable out the back where you can find shops and restaurants including a convenience store, coffee counter and food court. I highly recommend this hotel and would not hesitate to stay here again.\",\n",
       " \"Spent a week staying at the Intercontinental as I was at a conference in the Convention Centre opposite. As I was staying for an extended period, I was given a free upgrade to a deluxe room, which was delightful. One of the most comfortable beds I've ever slept in, with wonderful soft mattress topper (I'm going to look for one for my bed at home!), great fluffy meringues of duvets and crisp linen. I don't think I've ever slept better. Room was very large with lots of hanging and drawer space and a very comfortable easy chair with a good reading light next to it. The staff were all very friendly and helpful. As mentioned by other reviews, the hotel is well located, between the old town and the newer shopping areas. But don't be like me and walk around for days, not realizing that there are all these shops underground! Extra bonus for gourmets - the outstanding Toque restaurant is just opposite the hotel. Had a wonderful meal there.\",\n",
       " 'We stayed at the the Intercontinental Montreal from 4/1 to 4/3 on a short weekend getaway. The hotel was great. The location was good and we were treated very well even though we were Priceline customers. They offered us an upgrade for $20.00 Cdn. which gave us a room with a slightly better view and a bigger bathroom but the first room they offered us was perfectly fine. The concierge and the people at the front desk were very friendly and helpful. We took subways all around the city of Montreal. The subway system is not that big and within two days we were familiar with it. We were not impressed with the Old City, probably because it was off season. Also, at least in winter months, some tourist venues, such as the Botanical Garden and Contemporary Art Museum may be closed Monday. We ate at La Petite Ardoise on Laurier Street, a brasserie type restaurant, (Outremont)and had a reasonably priced dinner. The menu is somewhat small but the french style food is good - better than what we had in the Old Town. We also ate at the Intercontinental before flying home and the food was very good. All in all, I would recommend the Intercontinental Montreal.',\n",
       " 'When asking for a form about the use of my personal information that was supposed to be available under request to any guest, the manager made himself very clear that I was a Priceline customer and treated me as a second-class guest. The form was not only unavailable for us, but I was told that I was Priceline customer so if I did not agree to sign the release form of my personal information I could not stay in the hotel.The room was supposed to be ready by 3:00 pm. When we arrived after 4:00 pm to pickup the room key, the room was not ready. A person from the staff was supposed to verify the minibar. The room was very spacious and the bed looked very comfortable. However, the sink had hair showing that the bathroom was not clean properly.',\n",
       " 'This hotel is beautiful, conveniently located and very, very clean. The bedding has been upgraded throughout the hotel in a comforter style with very soft sheets and the cleanliness of the room was above average. We stayed down the street at W our last trip and there was no comparison. The hotel is right at the edge of the old city which was very easily accessed out back. The concierge, the front desk and even the doorman were very knowledgable of the local area. They were helpful and very pleasant. Again they beat the W in this department. The restaurants that they recommended were very nice ( especially Buonaparte) and they always had maps handy for directions. The convention centre is right across the street and there is shopping within ten minutes walking. Over all a great hotel!',\n",
       " 'We have visited Montreal for Christmas several times. We always stay the the InterContinental. They have a special package that includes a room upgrade to Delux and a fabulous breakfast for two (until 11am!). The rate this year was $144.00 Canadian plus taxes. The breakfast for two was easily a $50.00 value! This is a quality hotel and the staff is very friendly and helpful. If you have a good attitude so will everyone else. Old Montreal is easy walking distance from the hotel and the metro is just down stairs. We purchased a 7 day metro ticket for $18.00 Canadian that was good on the subway and bus lines. You can travel and shop all over town and never have to put on a jacket using the subway. Our room had a view of Old Montreal and a city view (corner room). The room was large by any standard. Large marble bath room with plush towels and robes. House keeping was excelent! Our room was always fresh and clean. We will stay again next time!',\n",
       " 'We had a three day stay here and it was extremely enjoyable. The rooms are very well furnished, very clean with everything you would expect from a first class hotel. It is located at the very corner of the old historic district and the new part of time as well as being across the street from the convention center. You can walk to everything from here. We will definitely choose this hotel again.',\n",
       " \"I've stayed at the Inter-Continental a couple of times, usually when I come to Montreal for the Jazz fest. Im sure when it opened (1991) it was one of Montreal's best. Its still not bad, altho the carpets are a little more worn, decor not up to par with a 5 star hotel chain like I-C. I think for what you pay here, the Sheraton is better. The service is pretty good, altho I've waited in line (2-3 ppl) at the front desk for 30 mins before. The Minibar is pretty outrageous... 1.5oz bottle of Chivas Regal was $13.50. The bathrooms are this hotels party piece tho. Separate tub &amp; shower, neat looking european faucets, and theres a speaker to play the TV over - never seen that before! Most rooms have a good view, altho I've had one that faces inward before. The location is pretty good, in Old Montreal, across from the convention centre, connected to the Metro. PArking is about $25, and only valet if I remember right. Again, if you stay on a weekend, try to park on the street but move your car before Monday 6am. As I've said in other reviews, I'll continue to stay at this hotel as long as they offer good rates - $150ish.\",\n",
       " 'Having booked a room at the Montreal InterContinental, I was filled with trepidation when I read the negative reviews of this hotel posted in the summer. Much to my relief, during my four-night stay there last week, I found the reviews to be largely inapplicable to my experience. The room was perfectly comfortable, with conventional decor and furniture. The staff was pleasant and accommodating when I requested a change of room for a view of Old Montreal and the St. Laurence, and otherwise. The breakfast, which was included in my package, was generous and included smoked salmon as well as one omelette at my choice. The lap pool is wide enough for two swimmers, but adequate for a workout. The fitness room is adequate, although by no means world-class. Finally, the location of the hotel was excellent--on the edge of Old Montreal and within walking distance of all of the major commercial streets (Ste. Catherine, Sherbrooke, St. Laurent and St. Denis). This particular InterContinental is not as luxurious as other hotels in the same chain, but it is a cut above average.',\n",
       " \"Over Labor Day weekend, we paid $99/night via Priceline which factors into the overall positive opinion somewhat. If we paid $150 or more, I'd be more disappointed. $99 was a ridiculous bargain in my opinion. If not for the somewhat obscure location, I'd give it 5 bubbles. The lobby is cramped, but who cares, their bar/lounge is excellent for a pit stop for a beer/wine/cocktail and the french onion soup was top notch. The concierge desk was bilingual and very efficient, and we had several excellent dinners on their recommendation. The breakfast in the hotel is totally overpriced (~$20/pp to fill you up) and the ambience is a bit stuffy, and there are a few good places within 2-3 blocks (Eggspectations for one, is a must, but expect a 10-30 min wait) that are a far better option. Just get up, go out, eat and get moving. The hotel wi-fi in the lobby was a bust, and the internet connection in the room required a technerd to come fix. The hotel itself is in a sort of no-man's-land, in that you really have to walk/cab/metro to wherever you are going, there is virtually nothing within a 2-3 block radius to see or do. This makes it VERY quiet at night though, so you can sleep in peace. You can walk to the heart of the old Montreal district in 5-10 minutes depending on your pace and there is a Metro station in the basement of the hotel..Montreal is a great walking town, akin to Paris, so expect to put on several foot miles each day to get the full experience, which helps offset the massive caloric intake vacationing usually entails. You can get to Rue Catherine or Denis streets within 10-15 minute cab ride for $10. We ate at 'Verses' in old town, and the food and service was in Zagat terms a 27 on both accounts. Expensive (figure $100/pp with wine and dessert), but very memorable. Avoid eating on the touristy square with the idiotic mimes and performers, you'll pay the most for the least quality and the service is churn and burn, but the people watching from the outdoor patios is solid. Cabs are everywhere day and night and you can always fall into one when ready to drop. Rue Denis is a much better walking street for offbeat boutique shopping and outdoor cafe people watching. Rue Dennis is a mile long and worth devoting a few hours with a stop at a cafe to have sangria and a snack. Montreal is a great town at a discount for Americans..Beats Europe on price and attitude.\",\n",
       " \"After reading previous negative reviews, we were very apprehensive and thought we made a mistake on our non-refundable reservations. We were wrong. We had an excellent experience at this hotel. We arrived early for check-in; before noon. Although our room was not ready, the desk clerk voluntarily, without our asking, upgraded us to the next higher level room at no additional charge and checked us in immediately. It was a large corner room, good view of the city, and a beautiful large bathroom, complete with separate shower stall and tub. Beautiful, clean room, well appointed. The staff was very courteous throughout our stay. The concierge was pleasant and helpful. Our last night we ate in the hotel's formal dining room. Excellent french meal; excellent service and very postive friendly staff. We definitely recommend the dining room. It was pricy, but that is the case in all major downtown cities. Very convenient location to the metro and Old Montreal. Gray Line tours picks you up at the hotel. On checkout, our bill was completely accurate for the tours and meals we had billed to our room. Checkout was quick, accurate, and friendly. We will definitely stay here again. P.S. Take a tour to Quebec City. It is worth the trip!\",\n",
       " \"After reading the scathing reviews, I was bracing for a miserable experience. With low expectations walking in, I was met with a crowded small lobby and an entire wedding party checking out.... ugh. Once I reached the desk, I was ready for rude treatment but the officious attendant gladly switched me to a non-smoking king room and what I thought was going to be a bad experience started to turn around. (I booked through Priceline for a great price so I figured I would be a second class citizen but not-so).The room was pleasant with a nice floor-to-ceiling window and soothing colors. The bathroom was very nice. The location was just a couple of blocks from Old Town and Montreal's efficient subway is right in the same complex. The recreation facilities are very nice, the bar was nice (a bit expensive and stuffy though). Here's a tip for those of you budget travelers: the on-street parking around the hotel is free on a couple of the streets and they don't start enforcing the time limits until 9:00 AM. I parked for free and saved $18. With food and all I stayed at this hotel for less than I would have paid at a roadside motel.\",\n",
       " \"My advice- don't stay here.I have stayed in nicer &quot;cheap motels&quot; than this alleged five star hotel.The only reason I stayed after the first night was that it was a non-refundable pre-paid stay.The hotel was not very clean, the service rude, the prices outrageous. The bed broke during my stay. Worst of all, they screwed up my bill royally.I had checked out, and had paid my outrageous OTHER charges, in full.(Another $1000.00 PLUS on top of my already pre-paid room charges.) I returned home and fraud alert from my credit card company called noticing something was amiss. I had NEVER authorized them to bill any expenses on this card, (they were charges that had already been paid on another card, but they broke this billing up up into $50 bits to put them through under the radar screen of my credit co.) and it messed up my banking for several days. They kept adding charges on this card even AFTER I had checked out and paid ALL monies owed!! I could not have this fixed by the hotel immediately as it was a weekend- so the front desk person very unsymapthetically told me there would be no one in until Monday to help with this. Had to wait till Monday to speak with someone at the hotel who resolved the problem the next day. Awful hotel, awful experience.Wild horses could not drag me to stay in this hotel again. Be warned!!\",\n",

I requested a high floor when I checked in and was extremely pleased to be given one on the 21st floor.The reception area is too formal and has little atmosphere although the bar is fine and the bar staff were extremely pleasant. The rooms were big and well furnished but seemed a little dated and drab (and the lamps in the bedroom had not been dusted for quite some time!). The biggest disappointment was the bathroom however. The lighting was grossly inadequate and the bath was far too small and shallow.Having said all this however I did enjoy my stay and as previously mentioned would stay again.',\n",

I demanded an apology, but hotel management is extremely rude. Not even a free drink while we wait?!? In fact, they rolled their eyes and gave us &quot;European&quot; attitude if you know what I mean. Supposedly this is ranked a 5 star hotel, I have seen motels in America that are far superior.I got this on one of those internet deals. Unfortunately it couldn't be cancelled, otherwise I would have heeded the warnings by others on this board. You certainly get what you pay for ($130/night).

       " 'There is no question about it, this property is nice, however, there is a long road from a good hotel to a great one, and Intercontinental is just a good one. We move here from Novotel, and stayed 4 nights starting 7/1/05. The hotel, as it was mentioned many times, is well located, walking distance to the old town, banks, shopping and restaurants. This is a big place, 26 floors I believe, 2 restaurants, shops, spa and lots more. The restaurants appeared to us upscale and overpriced, so we decided to eat down the street at many of the great restaurants in the old town. We got a room on the 19th floor with a view of an interior brick wall plus the window of an adjacent room. With exception of an obese middle-age couple walking around the room, nothing else to look at. Our room was clean, the furniture was nice, and the bed was comfortable. Good size bathroom but in need of a face-lift. The wallpaper was pealing in a couple of places, the shower head was shooting water in all directions and the tub plug was hard to keep it open, I took all my showers in ankle deep water. Nice toiletries though. The concierge desk staff was professional but unfriendly. They shove a bad Xeroxed copy of Montreal in your face and mark where you want to go. The front desk people were the same, short and to the point, no unnecessary smiles or pleasantries. As I mention, this is a nice hotel in a great area that anyone should consider for a business or pleasure trip.',\n",

The hotel is attached to the underground, so if you are traveling to Montreal in the winter, this hotel is a terrific choice, as you can limit your time outside. The only setback was on weekend evenings, as many of the restaurants in the area were closed. The hotel room was large, and kept clean during our visit. The concierge desk was extremely helpful, having provided us with countless recommendations on restaurants and activities. Don't miss a Cirque Du Soliel show and make sure you obtain a Montreal card, which will give you access to all museums, and public transportation at a discount.\",\n",

Theoretically should not be possible.Is this what one would expect from a good hotel or how about a good business? Yea right. The previous guests' posts say it all.

The room had all the usual amenities.Staff was courteous, especially the doormen and the valet employees.The hotel was within a short walking distance to all the Old Town attractions, as well as St. Catherines' shops and Crescent St. cafes/pubs. You can also get to the Metro wihtout leaving the building - a plus during a rainy night (although its not too easy to find).Negatives - parking for the hotel was nine levels below, as the parking is used for commercial business space. Valet employees were also not accessible late at night.Overall, we would definitely stay at the Intercontinental again on my next visit.\",\n",
       " \"This is a great hotel if you are in Montreal for business. It's close to all the business amenities, but little shopping. The rooms were spacious, clean, and comfortable. The door staff was friendly, but I found the front desk staff aloof and not very helpful.If you're just looking for a place to sleep before or after a business meeting, then it's perfect. However, I would not recommend it for a holiday or shopping getaway.\",\n",
       " \"I have stayed at other Intercontinentals and they are generally luxury hotels with excellent service. This was more pedestrian (maybe more like a Sheraton). The building is new and doesn't have much character. The lobby is small and not impressive. We had a suite which had lovely big windows and a nice bathroom. The concierge gave us a good steer on a restaurant for dinner. This hotel is convenient to the Old City which is why I chose it. WHen I made the reservation, the web site listed a special weekend deal, but said you had to phone the hotel direct. When I called, I had to argue very forcefully to get the special rate (they said it didn't apply to them because they were in Canada; I pointed out that the special was listed on the Montreal IC web site, not the general Holiday Inn/Intercontinental webh site). At this price point I would not stay here again.\",\n",
       " 'Dust bunnies on the curtains and brown stains on the bathroom floor. Let me know if you want to see the pics of these. This hotel is far from the 4-star rating that it claims to be. The reception staff left me totally unimpressed and questioning my own value as a human being - let alone as a customer paying $250+ per night.',\n",
       " 'The Intercontinental is a very good hotel for tourists - though the prices are only for those with big budgets. The lovely and quiet corner room that I had was not set up for work at all - with a very uncomfortable chair, an expensive ($14.95) and poor performing high speed internet connection, and no electric outlet within easy reach of the desk to plug a laptop in.The bathroom had a floor to ceiling window, but a window shade that only covered the top two-thirds of the window. Great for exhibitionists!Room service food was good at night - a very filling club sandwich, but poor for breakfast with a waffle that tasted like the butter or oil used in the waffle iron was rancid.',\n",
       " 'Great service, spacious room. With amazing view of the Old Montreal. Restaurant is excellent.',\n",
       " \"My boyfriend and I just stayed here (October 2004) and we loved it. The service from the moment we pulled up until the moment we drove away after checking out was exceptional. Other then the Bellagio in Las Vegas, I've never seen a group more dedicated to making your stay convenient and enjoyable. I booked directly through their hotel website and got a great deal. Also, the hotel is attached to a business complex with shops, a subway entrance, and eatery area, which is great in the morning if you want a quick bite.\",\n",
       " \"I keep coming back to the InterContinental because the rooms are spacious and the high floor rooms have excellent views. Note that superior rooms are not guaranteed to have any view, but repeatedly asking the front desk for a room with a view normally yields results. High speed internet (CDN $14.50) is somewhat pricey, as is room service, but it's one of the more modern hotels located near Old Montreal and has a good central location.\",\n",
       " \"Just returned from a conference in lovely Montreal. The IC was OK but disappointing. First of all, we had a &quot;special conference rate&quot; of $220 and I was denied priority points because of it! I wondered how much this place tries to charge regular customers if $220 is a special rate. My answer was on the wall upon check out, (rack rate) 500 Canadian and up!! Puh-leze. The rooms are average. The bathrooms above average. The overall ambience-average. The cocktail louge was nice and served good appetizers and lunches. Otherwise, good luck with those rack rates IC. Even at $100 or so less, no way. After walking past the St. James 2 or 3 times a day, I know where I'm staying next time....\",\n",
       " \"Just completed a 3 night stay at this awful hotel in Montreal. Have so many choices but keep asking myself WHY do I come back here. the front desk staff are so rude and un welcoming - ever wonder why they never ask you when you are leaving how wasyour stay ? they DONT care!! and they treat business travellers like nothing if you have a great business rate, they make you feel like garbage! They should educate themselves as to why your corporate rate is so cheap and how easy it is to loose business! The health club - nice pool &amp; sauna - but you think closing at 9pm is doing any justice to paying guests? Is it rather to appease the staff so they can go home early and the young man mentioned that they were shut down already at 850pm!! Why would a hotel not staff more appropriately during peak times (noon check out) than having 2 people on staff and over 12 people in line up ?Ever heard of giving you a bill in the night before and offering express check out? Martini in the Cristallan bar is fab - but think when your waiter drops 2 pieces of your calamari and picks it up off the dirty table and place it in a napkin next to your plate - sure, I am going to eat it!! Such a waste indeed of this perfect location but to everyone I say - W Hotel is opening soon 3 minutes from the Intercontinental hotel!!! MAKE YOUR WAY TO CANADA'S FIRST W HOTEL! I stayed at them in the USA and you are guaranteed service and a smile unlike the awful intercontiental hotel!\",\n",
       " 'Contrary to some of the other reviews here, I had an absolutely wonderful stay at the Intercon. I was a bit apprehensive after having read the other reviews but upon my arrival I was informed that I had been upgraded to a corner suite for the whole of my stay (complete with a complimentary basket of fruit)! which put my mind at rest. I have no complaints at all, the room was extremely comfortable and above all clean as was the ensuite marble bathroom and I had great views of the old port. Everything I needed was already provided (ie iron and ironing board or extra towels in which some hotels I have had to request). Housekeeping were good and did not disturb me when I wanted to be left alone to sleep and just left discrete messages as to when I wanted the room cleaned. Room service was also very good though a little on the pricey side. The hotel was also very close to Old Montreal and just opposite the Palais de Congress, where I was attending my conference. I also found it completely safe to walk around there and back from the downtown/shopping area no matter what time of night/day it was. All in all I had a lovely stay at the Intercontinental in Montreal.',\n",
       " \"I stayed here back in the late 90's and the place hasn't changed one bit, except that now they have very young staff who are unable to handle the flow. It took us 40 minutes to get checked in on a slow Friday night with only 2 people in line ahead of us. To top it off the front desk manager was too &quot;busy&quot; to come discuss my incorrect room rate, leaving the staff to fend for themselves. I saw him later that night and I think he may have been in his 20's. Am i getting old or should I expect a &quot;4 star&quot; to hire seasoned staff with decision making power?Will only stay here again if I get a deal in line with 3 star hotels in the city.\",\n",
       " \"It has been some time since I stayed at the IC. However, in reading the reviews, I was reminded of my experience at the hotel and felt obligated to share. We stayed for a week at this hotel probably in 2002 for my birthday during the last week of May--that's when we always go to Montreal. I was dissappointed from the very beginning. First, the hotel did not give me the feel of a Grand destination Hotel like I was looking for. As I recall, you arrive at a portal and then, have to go up on an elevator or escalator to the main lobby. After arriving at check-in, the same rude attendants were there, as other people have mentioned. I am a frequent business traveller, and know my way around the various traveller programs. Well these people would not cooperate for any upgrades under any circumstances--not even what I was promised when making my reservation. They were even rude about it. When we arrived to our room, there was a big problem. I think we reserved a suite, but it turned out to be something else like a very dark room that never got direct sunlight. The front desk did not cooperate at all, so I had to invoke the General Mgr, and threaten to check out of the hotel all together before they agreed to move us to another room. They finally did. I remember the Restaurant to be small and unimpressive--the food about the same. I did enjoy the cocktail lounge. I liked the way they served the alcohol in a separate container from the mixer. All things considered, I would not stay at this hotel again. I was very displeased.\",\n",
       " 'We just got back from a weekend in Montreal. The Intercontinental was great! Very nice, large room. No view, but who cares. The staff could not have been friendlier or more accomodating. The hotel is in the midst of Old Montreal, linked to a Metro stop (Square Victoria), and three blocks from the shopping on St. Catherine. Very quiet at night since this is a business district, but cabs are easy to get and we felt safe walking the street at 11 pm.If you visit Montreal, you MUST go for bagels at St. Viator - simply the best bagels there are!',\n",
       " 'This was about a mile from Old Town, so definitely walkable. The front desk was pleasant and helpful with recommendations. The room was clean and neat and they had nice extra touches towels folded in a pretty display. The grocery store across the street was great. Only complaint stayed on a Wednesday near to no restaurants open past 9:30. Parking was only 13 american for the day a steal in montreal',\n",
       " \"If you're looking for a good price &amp; great location, this is a great choice. It was my first visit to Montreal and we were only there for 1 night, but we slept soundly (one of us used earplugs as it is a noisy street with Irish themed bars). I'm pretty sure some young guys got into a bit of a verbal fight in room across from us - I heard swearing &amp; shouting late at night, but I really did sleep well otherwise. The ceiling was peeling a bit in the bathroom (but not like falling on people or anything), one of the chairs had stains on it, and I suspect the hide-a-bed was old and uncomfortable (we had a room with 2 double beds &amp; a love seat that folded out - but there were only 3 of us, so didn't need the hide-a-bed). The tub in the bathroom was also a bit weird - it seemed like it had been re-done with a tub liner over an old tub and water would get under it (between the tub and liner) and so it would feel squishy under your feet. The sheets were clean, the beds were comfortable and the price &amp; location was right. There was a free breakfast (bagel, toast or croissant plus tea or coffee) but we were hungry and didn't want to wait in line for it. Great place for students or other young people to stay. Had great service from the front desk staff. They let us check-in several hours early and stored our bags in a secured room for us after we checked out so we could go site-seeing without having to carry them around all day.\",\n",
       " \"Spent two weekend nights here recently; the place is filthy in the common areas and just clean in the the rooms. The bedding and curtains and rugs are worn and shabby. Our room had mirrored doors for the closet but one mirror was cracked. Older type TV's, no fridge in the room, no free breakfast, mould in the bathroom. Slow, slooooow elevators.Parking is $25 per night across the street, none available at the hotel. The rooms are average hotel size, the a/c was fine, there is a balcony but they tell you not to go out on it after 11 at night.Great location for a Quality Inn, but they should be ashamed their name is on this one.\",\n",
       " \"Fantastic location on Crescent Street close to St. Catherine Street shopping and restaurants etc.. Just a shame that Quality Inn has not fixed this place up. Should be completely demolished and rebuilt. It's not like it's cheap. It's dirty and outdated and no way would we stay there. Took one look at the room and got out of there. Probably crawling with bedbugs and other things. Hallways are dark and creepy, huge stains on the carpets. Can't go out on balcony after 11 pm which is probably good as partiers on balcony spitting down on people walking by. Also parking lot next door for $20 a day and they want to keep your keys. Not affliated with hotel. We left and went around the corner to the Novotel for less money per night, lovely clean hotel and rooms with underground parking at $18 per day. Don't know how the Quality Inn can justify the rate they charge for what they are providing.\",\n",
       " \"GREAT location at a decent price - that's why you would stay here. otherwise, you wouldn't. also a convenient garage downstairs for $15 a night. the lobby and the whole hotel in general smelled strongly of bad, cheap perfume. free internet connection was available, but very poor quality. room not very well ventilated, bathroom smelled sort of urine-like, room was generally dingy and worn-looking. Importantly though, it was clean. and great pillows!\",\n",
       " \"Can't say enough about the location. We drove into town and the hotel is 2 blocks from the highway, and a block from the centre of everything.From shopping on St. Catherine street to Old Montreal, it was all accessible within a few minutes of walking.Rooms were quite large and offered free high-speed internet. And the pizza place on the main floor was excellent.Although we were not there for the nightlife, all around you could see the bars and clubs were within walking distance for anyone heading to Montreal for that purpose.\",\n",
       " 'The hotel is located in the heart of downtown Montreal really close to restaurants, pubs, Metro etc. The Hotel lobby is small but clean. The front desk is well informed, friendly and helpful. The hallways on our floor were kind of old and worn. The elevator itself was kind of old and worn and poorly lit. The room faced the rear of the building so there was not a lot of street noise. There was also a balcony that looked on to the rear parking lot. Each floor only had a few hotel rooms. The room was large, well kept and well lit. There is no fridge here and the internet access is Free but not wireless...only an ethernet connection. The room was a good deal for the price. Large king bed, adequate space, decent bathroom. The whole lobby and elevator often smell like pizza since there is a pizzeria connected to the hotel that delivers to guests in the rooms as well. Note about parking:If you go thru the Hotel, you will pay $20 per night for overnight parking in a an open lot right next to the Hotel. We lucked out since we found a hotel about 1 block away. You can negotiate about a $6 rate for overnight parking. Street parking is free (right in front of the hotel) after 9 pm on weekdays till 8 am the next day. This is a lot cheaper than the Hotel parking.',\n",
       " 'Much better than I expected for the price and in a delightful area of Montreal near shops and terrific restaurants. Parking possible on street but a little hard to deduce how the parking meter pay system works. Adjacent parking lots not all that expensive. Nice, real breakfast available for under $10 Canadian.. Not fancy by any means but very cheap',\n",
       " \"Quality and Comfort Inns are Choice Hotels moderately priced properties. I have found them to be more than acceptable although I've had better experiences with Comfort Inns.This place was the worst experience I've had with Quality Inn. But first a positive note. I found the front desk staff and housekeeper to be friendly and accommodating.The hotel itself is shabby and threadbare. Our first room was on the the 8th floor streetside. There was mold in the bathroom. The bed was saggy and soft. We had the AC turned to the maximum cool but it wasn't putting out. After staying at a beautiful hotel in Quebec City we were totally depressed with the place. We went out for several hours. Upon return, the room was warm. We requested a room change.We were then assigned to a room on the 7th floor. Again the bathroom had mold. The carpet was torn. The bed wasn't too bad and the AC worked fine.We arrived in Montreal by train and walked to the hotel, about a 10-15 minute hike. We left by air. The hotel arranged for the airport shuttle to pick us up at 1PM. It showed a couple minutes late. We thought it would take us to the airport. Not so. You go to the central bus station and have to buy a ticket. The ticket line was long and we feared missing the bus. So I went to bus side while my friend stayed in line to buy the ticket. He returned a couple minutes after departure but fortunately the driver waited. So keep this in mind when planning travel time to the airport.This hotel is convenient to many restaurants and shopping. While I would certainly stay in a Quality Inn again, I would take a pass on this place despite the nice staff.\",\n",
       " \"This place is tatty and rather run down even though the room was large and the wired internet worked well.The hotel clearly runs on a tight budget, I gather they subcontract catering, the breakfast was a classic mug of coffee and prehistoric bagel. All this might have been tolerable because I thought it would be cheap. My colleagues and I had booked this hotel at a special conference rate. My colleague paid the bill and did not point out that they were charging some 50 canadian dollars per day more than the conference rate. I stayed on an extra day and when I came to pay I pointed out that they were charging more than the agreed rate and they were extremely unhelpful and uncooperative. I don't know if this over charging was an 'error' or not. I can say, however, that we could have stayed in a pleasant hotel for the price we ended up paying.On balance this is one to avoid.\",\n",
       " \"As I looked for reviews before my trip, I was confused because there were not a of current ones. So I just wanted to pass along some feedback to help fellow travelers choose a hotel for their visit to Montreal.Initially I was scared because there were not a lot of reviews, but the location was amazing and that's what made me finally decide to book it. Our room was on the 14th floor-facing Crescent St- and what a view it was! We had one king size bed, and a couch. The front desk staff was very friendly and helpful. They kept our luggage after we checked out, as we had a late flight, and they called the airport shuttle and made our reservation. The housekeeping staff was friendly and helpful as well. The room and bathroom was clean and we had no concerns about walking around in our bare feet.I would recommend this hotel to anyone looking for a great place to stay in an amazing location!\",\n",
       " \"Before I write this review about the quality inn downtown Montreal I would like to describe the type of person I am because often times when reading a review you don't know if the person complaining is just an uptight middle aged man! My friends and I are 23 year old European girls from Toronto who enjoy shopping, sight seeing and a vibrant nightlife with great house music and fair prices. We are not high maintenance but want a place thats clean, safe and has a friendly, helpful staff! (I don't think that's too much to ask!). The pros of the hotel are as follows:-Amazing location: a one minute walk to St. Catherine St, the best place to shop, full of boutiques and the underground city (a bunch of malls connected to each other underground). The downside, there is a strip club almost directly in front of the hotel and a dirty alley way right beside the hotel.-Some of the staff is friendly, greeted us with a smile, gave us some helpful tips on where to shop, eat etc- The noise issue people complained about was not our experience, it was pretty quiet so don't worry about that. Just make sure you get a room that faces the back of the hotel.-This hotel does hold onto your bags even after you've checked out. We had a late flight and i didn't want to carry all of our luggage around so they held onto them free of charge.-This hotel has a shuttle that will take you from central station to the hotel free of charge, however you have to pay to take the bus from the airport to central station which is $24 there and back which they don't tell you about on the website and is a bit confusing when you arrive in Montreal for the first time and don't know where to go!and that's it! Now here are the cons, bare with me there are many!!-Our initial room was disgusting! It smelled terrible, was dirty and the worst thing was that the sheets were stained with something that resembled blood. I am not joking this is the truth!. We called front desk to complain and they moved us to another room, the room right next door! The appropriate thing to do was to upgrade us for the trouble, we already were paying $120 per night Canadian to stay in this place, the least they could do was offer us a better space.-The room we stayed in appeared better in the beginning. The sheets were clean. But upon inspection, the bottom of the shower curtain had black muck on the bottom of it, the wallpaper was peeling in the washroom and so was the paint on the ceiling above the shower! The windows were dirty, the hinges to the door that leads to the balcony was rusted and the railing of the balcony looked like it was about 200 years old. The couch had white stains on it and the carpet was grimy to say the least. DON'T walk bare foot on the carpet or in the bathroom!Even the carpet in the elevator had stains on it like someone got sick on it the night before and stained it! -As we headed out to check out the nightlife we asked the front desk what time we had to be up in the morning so our room could be cleaned. They told us anytime before 2pm. So the next morning we were out of our room by noon. We crossed paths with the cleaning crew on our floor as we were leaving. They asked us if we needed service and we did and they said they would take care of our room for us. When we got back to our room at around 7pm our room had NOT been cleaned! Our dirty towels were still in a pile in the tube as was asked so that the cleaning crew would know to change them, the garbages were not replaced, our old bed linens were still on the bed, nothing was done! We could not believe this!!! We called front desk and they told us that they would see what they could do. 15 minutes later a guy showed up with 2 fresh towels! That's it, 2 towels! can you believe it! we had to call front desk again and ask for more towels. We did receive more but that should not have been the end of our service. We needed more toilet paper, garbages had to be emptied, the shower needed to be cleaned and we needed new bed linens. We did receive new bed linens with the second round of towels that we had to put on our bed ourselves. I did not know that when you pay $120 per night, for a total of two nights that we would have to make our own bed! This is suppose to be our vacation. A vacation in Canada, a first world country that I would assume world have higher standards and better service. I have been to resorts in third world countries and received first class service all the way by EVERYONE at the resort! This was embarrassing! -That night we went out to party and when we came back we decided to get some pizza from the shop that was attached to the hotel. However the door that attached the pizza place to the hotel was locked! At first we were angry because we would then have to walk outside to get in to the establishment but then were happy because we noticed that the people inside ordering pizza were sketchy to say the least and we felt it would be unsafe if the door attaching to two establishments would have been open. We went back to our room and called front desk to see if we could get food delivered but no one answered the phone! I though front desk was suppose to be there at all times to assist us! We called back 4 times in 45 minutes and no one answered. How about if there was an emergency? Needless to say we went to bed hungry that night!-The next day we checked out to come back home and we were charged $3.50 for the bottle of water that we drank in our room that we figured was complimentary because it was just a regular bottle of water on the coffee table when we arrived. Usually items that are charged are in a mini bar or have notes on them saying that you must pay to consume! -During our stay we noticed many of the visitors were young guys here in Montreal to party, who probably don't care about a clean room and that just want shelter to sleep. So that is who I recommend this hotel for. If you don't care about dirt or an unfriendly, non-helpful staff and put location on the top of your priority list then reserve this hotel but I think most people could do better. Next time my friends and I will spend a bit more so we actually feel like we are on vacation and not in some hostel in an impoverished area!\",\n",

The room was larger than expected and clean and comfortable. The bathroom although small was clean and everything worked. Staff was very helpful. Any question we asked was answered. Hotel in in a great location to explore all of Downtown Montreal. The Belle Centre (hockey arena) and shopping (i.e. Eaton Centre) and many places to eat within walking distance.

The hotel is located a block or so from Rue Catherine Street and conveinently located. The hotel lobby was clean and even had an over price shop that you could buy some lousy Montreal trinkets. The parking garage was nice considering there was very little parking on the streets and I didn't have a problem finding a spot. However, the view was lousy and woke up to have a direct view into someone's apartment just next store. This Quality Inn is much like the other Quality Inns...you pay for what you get.

The bathrooms are not that great, the rooms are look very old and smell just as bad. Non smoking rooms, smell like smoke anyway. But by far.. the WORST thing ever was the bed bugs. At first there was one.. then two.. then a few days later THERE WERE MILLIONS!! This place has a HUGE problem. Bed bugs were the worst experience of my life. So itchy you could not imagine. I also had an alergic reaction to them, so things only got worse from there. And the thought of sleeping on filthy nasty bugs only makes me want to puke more. This hotel is DIRTY, only only because of the close down ghetto strip club you have a beautiful view of, but because of the HORRIBLE, ITCHY, NASTY BED BUGS! Luckily the most of them showed up after the trip, still had fun but only because it was Montreal and its not possible to not have fun there.

King size bed was fabulous and the rooms were clean and very comfortable. I've been staying her off and on for 16 years and although the name has changed I'd still recommend this place for convenience and price. ( four nights averaged out to $100 a night)\",\n",
       " \"This hotel is very conveinently located, thats the only good news. We had a room on the 10th floor, only one of the two elevators would work at a time, for a while neither of the worked and we had to take the dank hot stairways. Don't risk staying there if you're handicapped! The hotel has balconies but you can't use them. The hallway on the 10th floor was trashed, smashed fire extinguisher case, garbage and dirt. Our tiolet had trouble flushing, I had to pray that it wouldn't overflow each visit. Had to call maintenance once, they said I'd have to wait until an elevator worked before they'd be up. The tub didn't drain well either, you'd have 6 inches of water in it at the end of a shower, the next person would have to wait 20 mins for it to drain. Don't fall for the free breakfast either, you have to pay extra if you want more than bad coffee and stale toast, or watered down OJ. When we asked about their satisfaction guarantee they gave us a dumb look and a pathetic excuse.\",\n",
       " \"The building looks apalling from outside and is located on a dirty back alley. The location is very central however, and can be recommended if you're not afraid to look inside.. Plenty of good restaurants and trendy shops are very nearby. Also a couple of bigger malls.The room was HUGE and had 2 double beds, 2 tables, sofa, 3 chairs.. all in average to good condition. The room was also clean, if a bit tired. (The windows were quite dirty, though.) Bathroom was cramped. Biggest problem during the stay was that they seem to cut the room's electricity during the night so A/C and lights won't work in the small hours, and the clock radio lost it's time and I almost missed my morning flight. Only 1 elevator was working and there seemed to be no hurry to get the other one operational. The working one also was slow and made some noises that made you wonder if that too will break up soon.The stairways were creepy and very dirty so walking up to 7th floor was no good option, either. So waited for the elevator 5 or more minutes a time..Overall, a very limited experience even when you get a low rate. The location is by far the best part of this hotel.\",\n",
       " \"We stayed here from July 1 through July 4, 2006. We booked the room via Hotwire. A great location, about a 7 min. walk to the Lucien - L'Allier metro stop, or a 10 min. walk to the Peel metro stop. The Hotwire price was $42, or a bit less than $51 per night, including tax and fees. The hotel is a short walk from the Museum of Modern Art - don't miss the exposition on Italian Design in the 20th century. The bottom line was that we got a clean , comfortable, air-conditioned room, with free local calls and free newspapers ( not USA Today - real newspapers ) - all for the price of a parking spot in New York City.\",\n",
       " 'TERRIBLE!!!!The windows were so dirty you could barely see through them! The furniture looked like it came from the local thrift store. The lampshades were heavily stained. There were burnholes in the carpet. The bathroom was grubby looking (dirty corners, tiles missing, etc.). The absolute worst thing however was the super-strong industrial-strength deodorizer that hit us like a brick wall upon entering the room that gave us instant headaches.',\n",
       " \"I stayed at the Quality Inn Downtown in Montreal, Canada for a weekend in October. I was in Montreal along with 11 other guys for a bachelor party. The hotel is in an excellent location and I would highly recommend it for singles and bachelor parties. It's in close proximity to all the bars and excellent restaurants. The rooms were large and clean, but need some updating. I wouldn't recommend this hotel for a romantic getaway, but the rooms were more than adequate for our needs.\",\n",
       " \"The Quality Inn on Crescent had a great location for our visit. 3 blocks from the Bell Centre, walking distance to a grocery store, shopping, Mount Royal, and several pubs and restaurants. Besides the location everything else was average. The room was a pretty good size, but I expected it to be for the price. Continental breakfast wasn't what you would normally expect, but was a light meal to suffice in the morning. Front desk was quite helpful, however understaffed. The room was clean and in working order, nothing special, however the balconies were not to be used, deemed &quot;unsafe by the City of Montreal&quot;. When I visit Montreal again I will try staying in a different hotel, but in the same area.\",\n",
       " \"I was in Montreal for a dental convention. i stayed at the Quality Inn Downtown hotel for 6 days. I was pleasantly surprised to see that my room at the second floor was HUGE. I got a room with a king-sized bed. It had a three-seater couch in it and a dining-table with 2 chairs, big study desk. The staff are very friendly and helpful. The Bathroom had a bathtub, it was very clean --- a big plus factor for me. There's so much space to move around. The hotel is very near th shopping district, there are bars/clubs nearby for those who want to enjoy the nightlife, a convenience store and money changer is a minute-walk away. Starbucks and Burger King are also a minute away. The Metro (subway train) station is about 4-5 minutes away. In short, location is very good. it's about 5 blocks away from other attractions such as Mary Queen of The World church, parks, St. George's Anglican Church, Bell Centre, Underground City, St. Catherine St.(shopping district a block away). I was truly fortunate to book my stay in this hotel. However, the croissant served to me on first morning there was truly lousy. it was tough and not flaky. I was actually expecting a truly authentic french breakfast in Montreal but i was disapponted. I never ate my breakfast there again though it was supposed to be included in my hotel package. But overall, I would recommend tourists to Montreal to stay in this hotel. You won't be disappointed. At first I was skeptical about the reviews here at this website. Good thing though I chose to believe the posts here. Au revoir!\",\n",
       " \"Was recommended this hotel by a co-worker. We were very happy with our one night stay at the Quality Inn on Crescent Street.Rooms are quite large with a nice walk-out balcony. Our room overlooked Crescent and downtown.Reception was great. We arrived early (well before the 3pm check-in) and were given a room right away.Got a decent rate considering it's summer and also during the Jazz Fest.Location was great. Crescent Street is a lively street with many bars and restaurants. Shopping on Ste. Catherine is right around the corner. Metro station is nearby (we used Peel). A couple &quot;negatives&quot;, although nothing really major. There was a festival going on on Crescent that night/day and the street was closed to vehicles. It took us an extra few minutes to try and find the parking area for the hotel due to it.Parking was $18 (ugh), but this was to be expected- it isthe city afterall. You can take your car in/out anytime which is a plus if you choose to do so.Another plus is that it nearby to the Bell Centre, which is just down the street on Rene Levesque. Looking forward to getting up there to see the Canadiens (bring back the NHL!).We would not hesitate to stay here and will recommend to friends.\",\n",
       " \"After reading the reviews about this hotel I was a bit concerned about what I might find when I arrived. Just to avoid any confusion this is the Quality Inn on Crescent St. Well , here is my take... The reception was excellent, I arrived about 10 am as I had taken a red eye flight from SFO. They had been full the night before but they had a housekeeper work on a room that had just checked out and I was in my room in less than one hour.This after enjoying a nice breakfast in the hotels intimate and amazingly inexpensive restaurant. The food was good but I finally found a place in Montreal where you can find bad coffee.The room itself was quite spacious and immaculately clean. High speed internet is CA$9.95 per stay. There are many CATV channels as well as pay per view. The real joy of the rooms here are the walkout balconies with nice views of downtown and the soundproofing is very good. The hotel hallways were looking a bit shabby mainly because they had installed new door frames on the stairwell doors, but for some reason hadn't painted them. Oh, and watch your step when going into or out of the bathroom !On the night before my check out I called for a wake up call at 1030 am to accomodate their 12n checkout policy. The receptionist asked what time my flight was and I told her 4pm... she then asked if I wanted to Check out at 2pm? , and would I like a taxi waiting ? ! Wow.. That's service !\",\n",
       " \"I found this hotel to be perfect for what we were looking for. I was travelling with a University Woman's Basketball Team and we had to play 4 games in 3 days. We also wanted to see a bit of Montreal. This hotel was close to the downtown shopping experience and was close to the gyms we were playing in. The rooms were very nice and the service was excellant. Parking (paid) was across the street and very accessible. All in all, we had a great stay, two great sleeps and a great experience. When we go back next year, this is where we will stay.\",\n",
       " 'I was shocked and appauled at the &quot;managers&quot; customer service skills. They were snooty and not helpful. I chose not to stay at the Inn for the fact they could not find my reservations and did not know what to do about it. It was the most frustrating experience of my life.',\n",
       " \"First of all, when we walked in the room it smelled like someone had been chain smoking for the last 3 weeks non-stop. To be fair the staff did put an ionizer in the room to get the smell out after we complained. It helped very little. If that was the only problem it wouldn't have been so bad, but there were numerous other issues. Next the chair in the room was covered in ashes with burn marks on the arms. It looked like it just came down the chimney with Santa. Then there were the lamp shades. They had big circular stains all over them. All the furniture in the room had marks and stains all over. It was like people had been using them for batting practice. The ceiling in the shower was covered with yellow stains and mold. The room cost $110 a night plus $20 extra for parking. The hotel was rated 2 stars on one website and 3 stars in a Canadian travel guide, so we figured it would be clean, but nothing fancy. We were very wrong. Since we got there late we had to stay the night. They said they would give us another room the next day, but we didn't think it would be much better. So, the next morning we checked out and got refunded for the second night that we had booked.\",\n",
       " \"My husband and I stayed four nights at this hotel in March 2004. We had a clean, serviceable room on the 10th floor for less than $100 US a night. Admittedly, our next-door neighbors DID wake us up at 3 a.m. early Sunday morning. But there's at least a dozen bars on that strip of Crescent Street, and besides, the Habs won earlier that night. We just cranked up the rickety heater and went back to sleep. :) The desk staff were courteous and helpful to two Montreal newbies. It's obviously not a top-of-the-line hotel, but I don't think it purports to be. It was truly comfortable for a few nights. And they had a decent free continental breakfast, too. Would stay there again.\",\n",
       " \"First, there was water backed up in the tub/shower, and the toilet was stopped dup. We were tired and hungry after a 12-hour drive, so we skipped the shower and went to dinner. Upon returning, we discovered that our 2nd floor room backed to a dance club, with the speakers obviously on the opposite side of the wall. They said they could not move us, and that it was beyond their control, but not to worry, the music would stop when the club closed at 3am! To top things off, there was now no running water in the bathroom(or anywhere in the hotel).Frustrated, I called the Canadian Comfort Inn/Suites number and complained about the obvious, and added the loud rattle in the A/C and the TV that had to be unplugged to power off. Soon a man arrived, swearing heavily in English, but with a French accent. Apparently, he was the only facilities guy working that night and there were multiple complaints that evening. He explains that he can't do anything about the music, he decided to unclog the bath, but with no running water, it brought a strong raw sewage stench into the room! Then he unplugs the TV to turn it off, then kicks the A/C a couple times to stop the rattle (which quickly returned). Remember, we had just driven 12 hours, and we got no sleep until 3am. If we got 3 hours of sleep, we were lucky. We did manage to take showers in the morning.The Hotel had a 100% satisfaction guarantee or your room is free. The manager would only subtract half, explaining that they did the best that they could do. I wrote a letter to Comfort Inn Canada, and got a letter back from the hotel manager telling us in short, that he gave us half price, what else would we want, and then asked us to &quot;Please come again&quot;. That will happen.\",\n",
       " 'On October 19th, 2002 a group of us travelled from Ottawa to Montreal to see an NHL game. We had booked three rooms at the Crescent Street location. The cost of each room was $186.29 for the night. I researched the hotel on the internet and the description and pictures looked very nice. At that price I also figured the rooms would be more than adequate. They were anything but. When we arrived at our room (#401) there were numerous stains (some still wet!) on the carpet, and on the bed sheets. The lamp shades were even stained ! The bathroom was also disgusting. The rubber lining on the bottom of the tub was not entirely sealed and when you showered, there was a distinct smell of rotting water and whatever else laid beneath the tile. Most people did not even shower because of the stench. We might as well bathed in the St. Lawrence Seaway ! The description also spoke of a &quot;partial room divider&quot; in the so-called &quot;suites&quot;. The divider was basically a three feet high by two foot rotting piece of wood jutting out from the wall. There was also a pull-out couch in the room. When we pulled it out there was a dirty ladies undergarment within the bed. The room was utterly disgusting, by far the worst any of us had ever stayed in. I sent a couple of complaint letters but have only been told they were looking into it. I have not heard anything within the past two months. I suggest management go view the room themselves &amp; see if they would consider paying $186.29 to stay there. It is not worth 29 cents and we will never stay there again. My advice, look at booking elsewhere !!!Dave Ottawa',\n",
       " \"Many guides still refer you to what was a great small hotel in the heart of Montreal. But with the neighbourhood going downhill, note that the hotel also has had a change of management a few years ago, so check the timeline for any guide or review you see.That stretch of St-Hubert Street was never the splendid suburbs, but the National Library taking a whole long block of closed-at-night real estate, a large park squatted with drug dealers that spread to side streets, and a syringe exchange program right across the hotel, it sure didn't get better. Advantages are proximity to downtown core, the Village, the bust station and the main subway exchange station. Disadvantage among a few is that whereas old management was selective in clients and built a long term international following of repeat customers, the new one seems mostly interested in short-term cash.Depending on your room neighbours your milage may vary. But the is better at similar prices.So some folks list their bad experiences here. Any hotel could list a few. Make your own mind, I made mine: After being a regular for over a decade, I visited but did not stay after the new owners took over.\",\n",

First of all, the bathroom reeks of smoke, although this proposes to be a &quot;non-smoking room&quot;. I took the cover, which betrays a nauseating canvas of yellow and brown stains, off of the bed immediately. I'm pretty sure I walked through a sizable area of something sticky on the floor adjacent the bed. I wonder if the hookers outside know what it is. There's no toilet paper. Starbucks napkins are rough. The shutters are patchworked together and look like a broken grill. I can see the junkies outside through the missing slats. We went to the corner deli down the street and a crackhead followed my boyfriend back to the car demanding money. I was unhinged by this. We returned without dinner. I hope tomorrow comes soon. Oh, and it sounds like somebody is dragging a body around in the room above us...and everything in here is this vomitous buttermilk color.\",\n",

Yes, the place is older and not all rooms have bathrooms in the rooms, but I would not say it was dirty at all. The neighborhood can be a bit sketchy, but I did not feel threatened or unsafe. I would recommend giving the place a try.',\n",

He spends his time making sure the crackheads and prostitutes outside aren't near the doors of his hotel while customers are around, but when customers leave, he robs them of all their valubles and denies it. He pretends to care about the safety of your things (i.e &quot;you didn't leave any of your money in the car i hope, this is a rough neighborhood.&quot;) while making sure that he can sneak into your room, go through your bags, and rob you blind while you are out trying to enjoy Montreal. Apparently this hotel is &quot;so secure&quot; that &quot;no one could get in to take your belongings.&quot; But, when questioned about his employees capability to steal, he pretends not to understand english, and says there is only one set of keys for each room. The room looked nice upon arrival, but once the sun goes down, and the locals come out there is no possible way of getting any sleep between loud junkies, and strange noises and apparent fights inside the hotel.Overall, this hotel has &quot;secured&quot; the top honors for worst hotel ever stayed in.

I was staying in a single room but offered him the floor, the guy at the hotel did not like this. He stormed into my room barking at me to get my friend out or to pay an extra $80.

We had the front room on the main level- not good if you don't like to be disturbed.

We had coffee on the 2 days that we were there and they replenished the coffee without replenishing the sugar. I don't know if it was missed but since the containers were side by side you would think that they would replenish that when they did the coffee. Thank goodness I take my coffee black because they don't provide creamer either. The hotel is bordered on one side by a street that is inhabited by drunks and substance abusers. Be careful when walking on Rue St-Laurent because people will accost you for change and there are men who urinate on the sides of the buildings so be careful of those wet puddles, they might not be water. I will recommend this hotel only if you like rooms that have gray concrete ceilings, dark brown furniture, dark blue walls, dark gray carpet, brown window shades and low lighting.

The front desk fixed the problem by bringing up keys to the correct type of room but mumbled something about it somehow being my fault. I don't understand the purpose of their comment. What difference does it make? It was no problem at all until they made a fuss.Room was fine but construction noise started early in the morning (08:30) in the courtyard. After checking out the valet brought my car around and we drove off. I realized pretty quickly that the valet had done serious damage to my transmission. I had no reverse gear. This was a problem that could have been easily solved if the hotel covered the modest cost of the repair but instead they quite obviously (and quite embarrassingly! Poor front line staff!) avoided my calls for 2 weeks until I gave up. I guess they must be running out of money.\",\n",

The place is very well situated in a great area for shops and food (go up St. Laurent to find all kinds of great spots).The only issue I have is that compared to the Vancouver Opus, I found Montreal to be less accomodating. In Van, the staff went out of their way to serve our every need and it seemed that &quot;no&quot; was not in their vocabulary. In Montreal I found the staff were not at all like that. Early check in...no. Late check out....no....In Vancouver I asked in the lounge/lobby if there was a place where I could get coffee and tea and I was told to sit down and they would bring it.

From the moment you drive up to the door, you can tell that this is a first class establishment.From the valet to the front desk, you get the feeling right away that the staff has had a higher level of training that most.The rooms are sophisticated with a modern feel without going overboard.Koko Restaurant is amazing. the food is exquisite and portions are generous. I highly recommend staying around until the party gets started usually around 11:00 ish. The place turns in to a club / lounge with Montreal's best looking people. And the terrace has to be Montreal's best. If you know anything about Montreal, you know that Montrealers live for terraces.I recommend Opus without hesitation.\",\n",
       " \"The Opus Hotel is the perfect place to say if you are traveling to Montreal. It has wonderful rooms, a great restaurant, friendly staff and is very lively for those of you who are looking for something to do after dinner. Not to mention it's great location in relation to all of the best shops, restaurants and culture in the city.\",\n",
       " \"Pros:We stayed for an entire week in July in a Privilege King room. From reading other reviews, we requested a room on the 5th floor and had absolutely NO problem with noise/vibrations from the bar.The service for our room was great. Our bed was made daily, the radio was turned on to a classical station to welcome us whenever we arrived at night, all bathroom products were promptly replaced even before they were half-done and the &quot;refill boy&quot; came by a number of times to ask if our coffee machine needed refills. Even if we left with the Do Not Disturb sign on, the cleaning lady always made sure to ask us if we needed extra towels, etc. when we ran into her. The front desk was also very helpful, and it seemed that there was always someone opening the front door regardless of the time of night (or morning) we came in.By far the greatest PRO would be the great location: On St. Laurent with the trendiest restaurants and boutiques; a walk away from St. Catherine and Crescent Street for shopping and more restaurants; a metro station a couple of blocks down. Overall, everything I wanted to see/do was close to Opus and we rarely took a taxi or public transportation.Cons: The only complaint I have about the room was that it was TOO DARK during the night, with no ceiling lights since their ceilings are made of concrete. Even with two lamps, two bedside table lamps, and a mirror light on, the room was very dark, making it hard to get ready, put on makeup, etc. In retrospect, I am almost certain if I asked for another tall lamp they would have provided it.Also, don't order the breakfast from the hotel. It is extremely overpriced! A simple breakfast with juice will cost one person $22. However, if you walk north of Sherbrooke on St. Laurent you will find a restaurant called Cafeteria that will serve more than what Opus offers for less than $9. To me, Koko was also overpriced; you are paying for the ambience and not the amount of food on your plate. The service was not exceptional here either; expo brought out our food assuming our appetizer plates had been cleared (since they sat empty for 20 minutes) and we also waited a long time for our refills. Go there for drinks - not for dinner.Despite these cons, I would 100% stay at Opus again. The service was exceptional and the location was great! If you are interested in coming when the Jazz Festival or Just for Laughs is on , this is a prime location.\",\n",

       " \"This hotel is conveniently located off St Laurent Blvd which is packed with Montreal's top restaurants &amp; nightclubs. We literally walked out the door and into the heart of the action. It would highly recommend the Opus Hotel in Montreal!\",\n",
       " '1- Strict check-in timing 3:00 pm and not a minute earlier - nowhere to freshen up meanwhile; staff was not accomodating at all, especially with our 3 year-old. 2- Our main suitcase was missing from the luggage brought to our room - had to convince them we were missing a suitcase and then wait for them to find it 3- staff instructed to knock insistently on suite door even if &quot;do not disturb&quot; sign is hanging on door knob, in order to check the mini-bar.... employee was litterally banging on the door until we opened it and was not about to apologize! 4- breakfast at Holiday Inn is better than what Opus served, even the bagels were old! 5- $30CDN/per day for valet parking is more than any other Montreal hotel. 6- weekend bar/lounge music made hallway frames shake - room was quiet though 7- cleaning was average, although we had asked for new towels, our old ones were put back on the rack and the staff did not provide coffee after the first day. We have traveled extensively throughout the world with and without children and this hotel is among the worst &quot;luxury&quot; hotels we have ever stayed at. Needless to say, Montreal has a lot more and better luxury hotels and we will be more than happy to explore them next time. We go there twice a year at least and will not soon forget this $400CDN+/night nightmare!',\n",

From the time the cab drops one odf, the experience begins- One enters this inviting interesting lobby, one is greeted with a welcoming smile at receptions. the room are faulous and have a modern yet relaxing feels about them.Suko is a very social bar. Dinner at KOKO is a must-fabulous food and fabulous decor-WOWif you are in a quandry as to where to go for dinner just ask Patrick-his recommendations were all great-Thanks!All in all a fantastic experienceWE WILL BE BACK',\n",
       " \"Like many other reviewers, we too were kept awake until the wee hours by an entirely unacceptable level of noise. Functions until 3am, then people talking loudly in the halls until 5--beyond the pale. We got the &quot;Oh, didn't they tell you&quot; runaround when we talked to the front desk the first morning after, and got parking and room service comped, but that hardly makes up for the one, primary, non-negotiable service a hotel must provide: a good night's sleep!Service was so-so outside of that. Room service was unimpressive. The price for room was fair; other prices less so.Overall, had the impression of what a hotel run by Apple computer (or Steve Jobs) would be like: pretty to look at, entirely (and overly) trendy, but short on delivery.If you must go, be SURE you are not on the side of the hotel facing the bar/function courtyard.\",\n",
       " \"Every room on our side of the hotel was over their night club, which had events both Saturday and Sunday night that lasted until after 3 a.m. in the morning. The ear plugs next to the bed did nothing to help with the fact that the room was vibrating. It was truly horrendous. The hotel itself is very nice, but for the price I'd expect to be able to get some sleep. Never again.\",\n",
       " 'We recently had a guys weekend in Montreal and stayed at the Opus hotel. This was a perfect locale / setting for the weekend. The hotel itself is located at sherbrooke and stlaurent, which are the two prime streets in montreal, intersecting - Within a short walk in any direction is incredible nightlife, restaurants and shopping. The hotel has a sleek, chic boutique feel with very friendly, non-pretentious staff. The rooms are very tastefully decorated. On the main floor with special access for guests is Koko restaurant which turns into a very happening nightspot post dinner. I travel frequently within the US and Canada and it definitely is one of the better hotels i have stayed in (south beach chill feel with a subtle new york coolness to it).',\n",
       " \"We appreciated the perfect location, impeccable room design, and lush lobby of Opus Montreal, but the box of designer ear plugs at our bedside was a real tipoff! We heard every conversation in the rooms on either side of us, every door slamming in the halls, every elevator ding, and every piece of luggage being rolled down the hallways. It was just unacceptable for a hotel that is so first-rate in other ways. Just appreciate the art direction of the lobby, the outside deck, and the restaurant, but don't stay here.\",\n",
       " \"Very comfortable room, lots of desk space, nice bathroom arrangement. Noise wasn't an issue, but likely because we were there on a Sunday night. The restaurant/bar is certainly set up for loud, swank nights. Restaurant for dinner was very good, the quality lived up to the price. Continental breakfast buffet was not bad. All staff were helpful and pleasant.WiFi in lobby was iffy; didn't purchase WiFi in room. Hotel is right across from Just for Laughs venue.\",\n",
       " \"I too made the mistake of not checking this site before booking the hotel. To be sure, the public areas are very nice and we found the staff courteous and helpful. The restaurant attached to the hotel was excellent. But the noise from the bar was awful. We were placed in the room right over the bar. The furniture rumbled, the lights shook and the decibel level was so loud, the ear plugs were useless. (Honestly, ear plugs....at a high end hotel?) The staff are well aware of the problem but we were not advised before we booked the room. I complained and asked to be moved. We were told that the hotel was full and this was not possible. The supervisor offered a 50 percent discount for the room. I declined saying that 50 a percent discount for half a night's sleep was unacceptable. We received a full refund. To my mind, the compensation we received was a bare minimum. A hotel that is unable to guarantee conditions that support sleep, shouldn't be in business as a hotel.\",\n",
       " \"The Hotel Opus is a true gem! I rank it as one of the top hotels that I've ever visited. The staff and their level of service were remarkable, making the stay even more enjoyable. Koko, the restaurant at the hotel, is a must when you visit - the food there was delicious! I will definitel stay at Opus again.\",\n",
       " \"From the moment we got there we LOVED it!Katherine was very helpful with the reservation (including dinner reservations at Koko), Ralph the bellboy and valet guy was just great.... We didn't want to leave....Rooms are amazing, Koko was delicious and trendy.This is the RIGHT WAY to experience Montreal!We will be back for sure!\",\n",
       " \"The Opus had loads of style and a great location. The bed was comfortable and the shower was absolutely lovely with plenty of hot water.On the downside, the service was sub-par. The doorman was rarely at the door, our room wasn't made up at four o'clock in the afternoon and the bar wasn't open on Sunday afternoon when we went down for a pre-dinner cocktail.A word of warning for light sleepers, the hotel bar is quite loud at times. On Saturday night, we could hear the music from the bar in our third floor room. Although there were earplugs in the bathroom (someone must know of the issue!), you might want to request a room far away from the bar if this might keep you awake!\",\n",
       " 'This hotel felt very trendy/funky without being pretentious. The rooms were really big, and the beds were so comfortable, it was hard to get up in the morning. The turn down service left green tea chocolates...pretty cool.Definitely felt like you were part of the action; the restaurant downstairs always seemed to be busy, and became a late-night hot spot for locals.',\n",
       " 'I stayed at Opus for one nite in September and was impressed from the moment I pulled up to the curb. The Valet took my baggage and keys right away and led me into the reception area to check in. They were incredibly professional and very welcoming to the hotel. Once I got to my room - I actually had to snap a couple of pictures to send to my wife right away as I wished that she could have joined me on the trip. It was amazing!!! Then I proceeded down to Koko for drinks and dinner later that afternoon and was even more impressed by the surrounding, great service and amazing food and cocktails.All in all - I would say that staying at this hotel is a must if you are going to Montreal on business or pleasure - I cant wait for my next trip to be scheduled.Thank you to everyone at Opus!!',\n",
       " \"Very pretty to look at, I actually really loved the decor. Pinks and blacks. When I arrived well after check in almost 5pm my room wasn't ready. Front desk informed me the shower in my room was being repaired and it would be ready shortly. I was in fabulous mood and decided to wander around the neighbourhood. Upon returning front desk apologized. After checking in and setting up my laptop I noticed my internet was not complimentary as was promised by the entertainment sales manager. I called the front desk and they took care of the problem promptly. A few minutes later there was a knock at door. I was expecting an apology favour (considering what a high profile boutique hotel the opus is) only to have my door opened by two engineers apologizing as they didn't know the room was occupied. Then a few minutes later a woman from housekeeping opens my door (no knock what so ever) sees me and without an apology or any explanation shuts the door. How unorganized was this place! It blew my mind. Aren't we in the year 2008? I thought this chic boutique hotel would of at least had some sort of system to notify two different staff members that a room was occupied. From that second forward I felt the need to put my double dead bolt on. Unreal. Sunday breakfast was dead in their restaurant. Our server was lovely and it was so sad to see the place empty. Over all this hotel is slick and very pretty but not worth the price for the lack of organization I experienced.\",\n",
       " \"We give this hotel three stars because as a hotel it is great, but it really depends upon what you are looking for. If you want a great place to party hop from, this is it! In seconds you are in one of the hippest bar scenes in Montreal, including an '80s club with people dancing on the bar, and several others that I am way to old for (I'm 38). For a rockin' getaway with very little sleep, this is great. My husband and I did not get in until 3:30 am either night. The first night we slept soundly-- no noise (Friday). Then NEXT night, there was a full-fledged party on our floor because of the wedding party staying in the hotel. Well, you can imagine that we wanted to sleep. Oh well, we couldn't, despite the ear plugs that are given out as a hospitality!  To cut down on the noise I suggest you ask for a room that is not above the bar or which opens up over the swank open-air bar in the hotel's lower level.\",\n",
       " \"I stayed at the Opus for 4 nights. When I entered my first room I was pleasantly surprised with how modern it was great decor, nice accents but unfortunately bad lighting.. the rooms were light deprived. My first room was overlooking St Laurent near the club. When midnight came i was awakened by NOISE! people fighting on the street, dance music and the INSANE beats of bass on the speakers. As others have mentioned on this board,, its Loud!! First night i got 2 hours sleep :( they encourage you to wear their ear plugs to sleep but cmon who wants to do that. The next day i complained and they moved me to a quieter room. Much better! My remaining 3 nights there was fine. Free wireless was provided in the lobby. The Japanese restaurant on the ground floor had delicious food! the best Steak and frites. Try the complimentary coffee machine on the ground floor, tea, expresso, cafe latte. Delicious chocolates are placed each night on your pillow.If you are a light sleeper even a heavier one please take caution with the noise. One last thing you can't beat this location! Its in the heart of everthing.\",\n",
       " \"now i have to confess i didnt look at this website before booking this hotel - big mistake. we had a room on the first floor facing the inner courtyard aka the outside bar area. i cant believe people are stupid enough to stay at this hotel - they must have been like me and not read any reviews. it was so [--] loud - esp sat night when the weather was good and the bar in full swing. on the sat night, after having an admitedly quite tasty and reasonably priced cocktail at said bar we went to our room at 11pm, tried to watch a movie which still couldnt drown out the noise from the bar. it reminded me of staying in miami beach. in actual fact we were so exhausted every night we actually feel asleep - with the earplugs in of course. its a great area for shopping - but would never stay here again, unless perhaps in the winter when the outside bar area will be covered in snow and hence no music. the room was quite nice, very &quot;cool&quot; with chocolates every night and l'occtaine bath products, but the lighting was bad.\",\n",
       " \"Having had a friendly telephone conversation with a member of the reservations staff to book my stay, I was looking forward to my first visit to Opus. The hotel's location is convenient to explore the city but the building is situated on a busy cross-roads with constant traffic heard throughout the building. The first suite I was shown to did not have a bath as requested and I was moved to a small standard room overlooking the courtyard. Luckily it was a Monday, the receptionist did not recommend rooms overlooking the courtyard from Thursday to Sunday due to the late night party in the bar below. I stayed in the room for 3 nights before moving to a suite with a bath which I had originally booked. The room was spacious but painted a lurid orange and overlooked a side street littered with refuse. The room was badly lit and had no privacy from onlookers. A majority of the staff were very unfriendly and two receptionists in particular were extremely inefficient in carrying out simple guest requests. The highlight of this hotel were the porters / bell boys who always had a smile of their faces, nothing was to much trouble for them. Shame about the others. A real disappointment.\",\n",
       " \"I booked this hotel on Hotwire for a very low rate, otherwise the few bad reviews would have kept me away. Unfortunately, the bad reviews here are 100% correct so let me just recap.Don't go to this hotel if you plan on sleeping at night. Maybe if you want to sleep from 5am until noon, but otherwise forget it. The bass from the club is so loud it sounds like it's in your room (and our room was no where near the club!) Also, there were some people who snuck out onto the rooftop right outside our window and camped out there until 5am. Yes folks, 5 am - laughing and hollering and stomping their feet! The hotel puts earplugs in the room but they didn't help at all. Also our Hvac unit was broken so our room was 82 degrees. Phone was broken too so forget about calling the front desk to rat out the people on the roof.Pros: Door men are very helpful and friendly, especially Tony. We did complain about the intense heat in our room which the hotel staff did fix. We also complained about the rooftop partiers the next morning and within moments, staff was on site screwing the windows shut so that it couldn't happen again.Cons: WAY too much noise. Too many defects. Dull dim lighting in the bathroom so you can't make sure you look decent before you go out. The hotwire rate was nice, but you really do get what you pay for sometimes.\",\n",
       " \"I loved everything about this hotel ... the location can't be beat ... our room was beautiful ... the service was great ... the restaurant was fantastic and the the outdoor lounge was perfect for spending time with friends having some cocktails and people watching!\",\n",
       " \"had a great stay here recently. very modern, hip hotel. great for young (35 and down, no kids) travelers. didn't get a chance to check out the bars and restaurants in the hotel, but they seem very chic. rooms are very clean and decor is modern. within walking distance of restaurants and boutiques. not close to major tourist attractions, but close to metro station which is easy to navigate. service was great; front desk staff very nice and helpful. only complaints are that the rooms are very dark and breakfast is not included.\",\n",
       " \"I am not a high maintenance hotel stayer. I like modern, clean rooms with a location central to my interests. The Opus delivered on both of those. Having said that, there was one BIG problem. The sound!I am a 30 year old woman. I love to party and stay out late...however, when I am ready to go to sleep, I want to be able to. There are 2 sides to this hotel. One faces the ultra hip, posh, overly priced restaurant/club Koko..the other faces the busy street. I don't know how the sound is on the street side, but on the club side it's obnoxiously loud!! Until 3-4 am on the weekends and about 2 on the weeknights. One day, we had been sightseeing all day and wanted to ttake a nap to be ready to go out later. There was a wedding in the courtyard of the restaurant and they started playing music at 5-6 pm (and it was still going when we got home late night). The music was typical annoying wedding music and top it all off, we had to hear all the speeches in surround sound. The volume was 19 on a scale of 1-20. We were very irritated and did not feel rested upon leaving this hotel. The staff is on the snobby side, and definitely cater more to the trendsetters, than the average joes. Room service stops serving at 11 pm..at least if you're going to force me to stay awake hearing your music..feed me!BUT the location is fantastic!! A few blocks from St Denis and the Latin Quarter, right on St Laurent with limitless restaurants and bars, a few blocks from Old Montreal, Prince Arthur Street, St Catherine, the metro, buses etcI would not return to this hotel.\",\n",
       " \"My husband and I stayed at the Opus Hotel in Monteal -June 27-30th while enjoying the Montreal Jazz Festival. It was hard to leave the hotel!!! From entering the lobby, we had incredible service right from the moment we entereded the front doors. The front desk staff were efficient, welcoming and very polite. Security is great, since you require your room key to access your floor inside the elevator. Decor is great, ultra modern, a nice change from the &quot;typical&quot; decor of hotels. There is an area, just adjacent to the lobby where there is a free,fresh coffee and tea bar with very comfy sofas and chairs and free wireless hookups.The various daily papers are free as well.  Our room was just perfect!!! The colors are all spectacular and each is different, hot pink, mustard, chartrusse, and our was purple, mauve and grey! We loved it- the king bed was incredible, the linens were the best I've ever slept on in any hotel! (HMMMM- do they sell them?) The room was very large, comfortable, and a bonus was that the window opened-we stayed on the 4th floor overtop the covered patio area and off to a side street. We did not have any noise problems. Our window when closed was very soundproof. We also found an &quot;O&quot; umbrella in our closet - which came in very handy. The bath products are great, they use L'Occitane en Provence- very luxurious! Nice white fluffy bathrobes (with a lime green &quot;O&quot; -very cute)- huge shower was a nice treat too! The lighting in the room is great - no ceiling lights, but instead, lamps and recessed lighting in one wall behind the bed. In the evening we had turndown service with decadant chocolates on our pillow, soft romantic lighting, the beautiful copper roman shade drawn- and the silver ice bucket full- ready for our nightcaps!! The lounge and restaurant are elegant- the outdoor courtyard very stylish and one floor below at Suko's Lounge- the outdoor patio is just decadant- chaise lounges and pillows surrounded by a great garden area, accessable right to the street. We were only blocks away from the Jazz Fest and steps away from Old Montreal, fantastic shops, restaurants (Thanks to Fritz!! for the tips on breakfast and lunch spots!!) wine bars, great patios, I could go on and on. But bottom line, if you want to stay in a GREAT hotel, in a perfect location - you cannot miss with the Opus Hotel. We heard that they have an Opus in Vancouver and can't wait to experience the BC one soon!!\",\n",
       " 'Just returned from a two night stay at the Opus and could not have been happier with our choice. As always I use Tripadvisor as my guide before booking a hotel and although there have been a couple of poor ratings for this hotel it certainly was not our experience. The hotel is very modern, clean and staff extremely helpful from the front desk staff to the doormen. We did not experience any of the problems with sound in the room at all.Location is excellent.The only complaint I have is that the food and bar prices are &quot;way&quot; too high and would definitely not avail myself of either the restaurant or bar.Would stay here again.',\n",
       " \"I booked my stay over a month in advance with Tablet Hotels. The money had been paid to the hotel in it's entirety 3 weeks before I had even arrived, yet there was no room waiting for me.I immediately noticed that Opus is definitely going for a specific clientele. Young professionals, or celebrities with money to burn will enjoy extra-special attention from the staff, while those like myself will get a bit of the old 'upturned nose' treatment. When I was finally able to get a room one of the concierge at the front desk said to me that he'd like to find me a quieter room, when he saw the one that was assigned by the woman who had originally greeted us, but was abruptly cut off by her as she told him that our room was &quot;fine&quot;.Beware that if you plan on going to bed before 3am, half of the hotel's rooms overlook the courtyard which Koko (the upscale yuppie hotel restaurant/nightclub) opens onto. Our room was the floor above the courtyard and was vibrating from the bass in the restaurant's sound-system and we could clearly hear the people in the courtyard smoking and yelling to one another over the music. When I called to ask for a different room, I was told that the hotel was &quot;Sold Out&quot;. This is a *likely story*.The decoration/design of this hotel is very trendy, and while it is nice right now, it is very dark and will date quickly.If you like to stay up late snorting coke, drinking awesome martinis and partying with other yuppies, you will love Opus Hotel in Montreal. This is not a family hotel, nor is it a hotel for people who like a peaceful or relaxing weekend away from home.\",\n",
       " \"My boyfriend and I visited Montreal and stayed at the Opus Hotel Montreal this past Memorial Day weekend. We were pleased with the hotel as far as cleanliness, friendliness (especially the front desk) and location. We were able to walk to many sights including museums, restaurants, etc. Everything else was a few minutes car ride away.Amenities in the room were L'Occitane and were very nice. The only complaint I have was the $26/night charge for valet parking. Even in a big city, this was too much in my opinion. Otherwise, we enjoyed our stay (the complimentary coffee/espresso/capppuccino machine in the lobby was a very nice touch). The bar/lounge downstairs is nice, though the cocktails were quite pricey. However, we expected that in a big city. I would definitely recommend this hotel.\",\n",
       " \"I am convinced that the other reviews that show this property in a positive light are either fake, written by management, or the hotel has some sort of policy to reward this fake praise. For the first time ever, I was completely duped by Tripadvisor, usually my wife and I have a great experience and the reviews are spot on, NOT this time. All I can say is, please, listen to me, do not stay at this property if you value your time, money, and sleep. Here is a list of the defects:1. The Hotel has terrible sound proofing. The club blasts club music until 3:30 and you will hear every word, feel every bass note, and generally feel like you're in the club even on floor 5. Even between rooms, expect to hear the neighbors having sex, and everything going on outside on the street. This is a problem ACKNOWLEDGED by management, which is why the put earplugs under your pillow. 2. The new eatery, KOKO, is a complete joke. In such a city which is rich in culinary skill, do not torture yourself by dining at this feeble attempt at gourmet. There was a mistake on our order, and the waiter then charged us to bring out the correct item. When asked to get a manager, he refused to call one. 3. The rooms have terrible lighting. No recessed lighting, and the fixtures are sparce, and the bulbs were burnt out during our stay. 3 days and 2 calls later to front desk for repair, still no lights. 4. Our safe didn't work. 5. Our egg room service breakfast came with no fork, knives, or napkin. 6. The finishes are very cheap, laminate counter tops on all the furniture, with the dark oak front edgband veneer peeling off in many places. Cheap doors, cheap trim, the bed frame has unfinished MDF showing around as the mattress doesn't cover it completely. Trend forward design gone very bad, think an &quot;IKEA hotel&quot;, but not as good. 7. The HVAC units are in room and very loud. 8. Our telephone didn't work, and was not fixed after 2 days. 9. Did I mention that you won't sleep?Overall, this place was a joke. When I was at the reception complaining, there were 2 people ahead of me, and I overheard them complaining for the same things. It defies logic how there are so many positive reviews. Save your money and your vacation time, stay elsewhere.\",\n",
       " \"Perfect location if you're going to take advantage of the restaurants and shopping on St. Laurent. Intimate boutique hotel with a similar feel of the W, but a little more subdued. I like it and would definitely consider staying here again. Clean rooms, good sized and comfortable.\",\n",

The staff is very professional, knowledgeable, and courteous.The Opus is in the midst of constructing their restaurant that is expected to open by the end of May. Until then, at street level there is the Suco bar and lounge with an outdoor patio facing St. Laurent where you can enjoy great tunes, drinks, and tapas.If you are a light sleeper, make sure to use the ear plugs provided as the windows are not very soundproof and do not keep out the street noise. Regardless, the beds are very comfortable and the hotel room offers all of the latest modern amenities.Restaurants and shops along Ste-Laurent are all within a short walking distance from the Opus. For additional restaurants and shops and if you are not keen on walking, a short cab ride will get you to Old Montreal/the Port, Crescent Street, Ste-Catherine, and Ste-Denis.Nearby Dining: For a truly authentic excellent Italian meal cooked like mamma, be sure to make a reservation at Da Emma (514.392.1568) in Old Montreal. For a filling breakfast (served until 3:00 p.m.), lunch or dinner, check out the funky Avenue on Mt-Royal Avenue East (plus two additional locations) and have patience as they do not take reservations and there is always a line-up. It is worth the wait.',\n",

They were very accomadating when asked for a lot of ice, a HUGE tray filled with ice was delivered in no time at all. All in all a great stay. I would return to the Opus becuase of its proximity to the local nightlife, and if it wasn't close, it was a quick cab ride wherever you wanted to go!\",\n",

Was expecting an IPOD dock of some sort, but i improvised and bought one of those ipod headphone jack to audio input wires and plugged into the back of the tv and bam! IPOD. Have a ton of pics of the room if anyone is interested.\",\n",
       " 'First time visit to Montreal and what an incredible city! And the trendy Opus Montreal matches its host city in everyway. The dcor in the rooms and lobby was vibrant and fun. Staff were friendly and very helpful with directions plus some outstanding dinner recommendations. Location was perfect  right next to a whole bunch of great shops and restaurants/clubs.',\n",
       " \"I stayed at Hotel Godin (now Opus) twice earlier this year--once in February and once in June. Both were business trips.Some aspects of this hotel I really liked, others not.The rooms ARE dark, mostly due to concrete ceilings that mean no overhead lights. (Plus everything is painted in gray tones.) Also, huge windows are shrouded in very dark curtains. This might be great if you need pitch-dark to sleep, but a bit oppressive for being in the room at other times. I immediately opened all curtains, and that helped, but people could then look right in, from the place across the way, so I had to remember to change in the bathroom or close the curtains!Both times I was in what they call a &quot;Privilege&quot; room--that's the smallest. Bed was great--that's important! And chocolate treats at turn-down were a nice touch.The pictures show a bathtub, but neither room I had included one--only a shower, although a spacious one.There is a nice long desk, which was good for working. One trip I was able to negotiate internet to be included in the room cost, but the other time I had to pay a daily fee. No coffee maker, but there is free coffee in the lobby downstairs. Room service is - as you might expect - expensive. Plus, fairly small portions. Fortunately, there are lots of places to eat within walking distance. Still, overall it was a pretty good experience.\",\n",
       " \"Lots of rave reviews, but I thought it was trying a bit too hard to be 'New York'......constant 'cool' hotel music everywhere you go, the bar just doesn't quite cut it.....not saying it was bad - it was fine - but it aint Schrager/Stark even tho it wants to be.But having said that, at $179 maybe you cant expect the real thing?\",\n",
       " \"For my first visit to Montreal, the Opus Hotel was the ultimate choice because it's location was close to everything. We only had a few days to stay in Montreal, so the location of our hotel was very important. The Opus Montreal was a short walk to shopping, and had many restaurants nearby. Most of our travel to and from the hotel was by taxi and was usually under a $10 fare, whether it was to a restaurant, nightclub, or the Bell Centre hockey arena.The rooms were funky and spacious but we did not spend a lot of time in them as we were enjoying everything cultural that Montreal has to offer. When we needed a dinner reservation, the staff were friendly, helpful, and bi-lingual.I will stay there again.\",\n",
       " 'From the moment we got out of the taxi, the Opus staff were very attentative and helpful. The entire time it felt as though we were receiving special treatment - even though we were regular guests. The lobby is beautiful, but not over done - they have a small bar/lounge in the lobby area and a larger bar downstairs - so great for pre-dinner drinks. The rooms are unique, new and stylish - loved the concrete ceilings. They are opening a larger bar in the spring which will make the Opus even more of a hot-spot. I highly recommend this hotel, and I will be staying there every time I go to Montreal.',\n",
       " \"Couldn't have asked for anything better! The service was excellent, the employees were courteous, and the room exceded all expectations!! Highly Recommended! I've been to a couple hotels in montreal, nothing compared to Opus!!!\",\n",

       " \"Amazing staff, very helpful and friendly. Opus is very chic and modern. I was traveling for business and found the location was perfect---very centrally located to all the main attractions and neighbourhoods. Some hotels have fantastic lobbies and then boring rooms but not at Opus! My room was amazing and so were the bathroom products. I especially enjoyed turn-down service; each night when I returned from a day of meetings there were delicious chocolates on my pillow! Love, love, love Opus Montreal and will definitely be staying there again when I am in Montreal for work (or even just for fun!). Note: Room service was very good, the tip/delivery charge is included on the bill so you don't pay all those hidden charges that come with most room service bills. If you are traveling alone like I was, have a drink in the lobby lounge, the staff are really friendly and offer great wine suggestions.\",\n",
       " \"My husband and I spent our 1 year wedding anniversary at Opus. it was truly a romantic experience. The hotel itself is just beautiful and the staff was just great. We stopped for a few drinks at Suco bar which is in Opus hotel. The ambience was great. The bar tenders were so friendly and ready to serve you whenever you needed a drink. The music was really good. It was that lounging music you want to hear when you are out having a good time. The music wasn't too lound like some bars that you can't even hear yourself think. You can actually have a conversation with the people you are with. Right after a fun evening we headed to our room which was just to die for. Modern, clean and comfortable. I just wanted to stay in there comfy bed all day long. The room was a good size and the bathroom was bigger then the room.(almost) Deep bathtub, huge shower and 2 sinks so I didn't have to fight over it with my husband. Ha! Ha!. We pre ordered our breakfast the night before, but I forgot to write the time I wanted it served to our room. So when I woke up I called reception and they told me I forgot to write a time and they didn't want to call us to wake us up, which I found very respectfull of them. Within minutes our breakfast arrived on a table with flours, fruit, croissants, muffins, juice, coffee and of course my bacon and eggs. The presentation was just beautiful and added to our romatic weekend. All in all I reccommend Opus Montreal to not only couples but to anyone who wants to stay at a really nice hotel and have a good evening at the bar.It also is located in the heart of town town Montreal, which is the place to be. I defiately would go back. Maybe every anniversary!\",\n",

I felt just at home in the beautiful rooms... major plus with the glass shower !I could go on but will keep it short.

The staff members were very professional, courteous, helpful and friendly. The room was spacious and nicely decorated. We especially loved the evening bed turn down treats!',\n",
       " \"Hip boutique hotel. Our room was nicely equipped. basically a queen bed with two bed-side tables, a table and chairs, a very large, very long polished metal mirror that took up one whole wall, flat screen TV, long wood consoe (12' long) was very useful. The only downside of the hotel was the room was very dark, even with all the lights on, it was occasionally difficult to read. Hip and romantic though. The walls and the cieling are poured concrete, very dark. The toilet was in a separate room from the shower/vanity area. The shower/vanity was very nice with a large shower area with glass tile, the vanity had a large raised vessell sink and plenty of room on each side. Real positive was the location right on St. Laurent and Sherbrooke, close to Old Montreal, downtown, and our favorite part the plateau, St. Laurent, St. Denis, Mt. Royal. Very convenient location, helpful staff. WiFi did not work in room, had to go to the lobby for that, a bit annoying. Fitness center was small, but nicely equipped and never crowded and open 24 hrs. I specifically do not eat in the restaurant of the hotel I'm staying in (part of the fun is getting out and about), so I have no opinon on that. Convenient valet parking, very helpful. One Word Equity: Location. with a nice dose of hipness. Would definately recommend to the right person (not my parents) looking for a nicely located, moderately priced, hip boutique type hotel, but would not be everyone's cup of tea.\",\n",
       " \"I am a huge fan of boutique hotels and I travel to Montreal frequently. Opus (formerly known as the 'Godin') is quite possibly the worst hotel I have ever been to. The service from check-in to check-out was tedious, annoying and unprofessional.My credit card statement showed that they had charged my account double the amount that they were supposed to. It took two weeks and numerous litigation for me to receive my money.Funny thing - is that I had heard about the hotel being poorly managed, but I didn't listen - BIG mistakeUntil they wipe out their management system - stay clear!\",\n",

       " 'A recent addition to the Opus Hotel Group. The former Godin Hotel Montreal is a v. good place to rest your head. Designed by Canadian Architects Yabu Pushelburg it is well thought out and planed. The basic rooms (Prestige) are large. The service is friendly and professional. My complaint here is that the hotel seems understaffed and requests seem to take a a long time. Well located near the St Laurent restaurant scene the hotels own restaurant is not yet open for business. My only real complaint was the poor quality of the breakfast buffet. Un inspiring choices, cheap linen and poor coffee. Come on guys you are in Montreal. Montreal bagels and pastries, fressh fruit and linen and lose the stainless steel serving bowls ! All in all a good choice. If your journey takes you to Montreal look over The Sofitel, W Hotel and in the old town Le St James,Nelligan and The Saint Sulpice. Enjoy Montreal !',\n",
       " \"The location of the Godin, sorry Opus (the hotel had just changed ownership as I was staying there), is superb.It's about 4 blocks away from the main shopping street (St. Catherine) and right across the hotel, there's a street full of great bars and restaurants. The location cant be beat, there's everything nearby that you might want. While the hotel is located next to a busy street, once you get indoors, it's all peace and quiet.The lobby has a bar in the evenings and there's always free coffee available which was quite good. I ended up drinking a lot of it since the I couldn't get the internet connection working for my laptop up in my room. The wifi access in the lobby is free and fast. To use the internet in the rooms you have to activate it via the tv and it didnt work at all for me or any of my colleagues.The room I stayed in was spacious and had a massive comfy bed. Its pretty dark in the room and the only window was facing an closeby office and the street, from where one could see into the room, so the shades had to be kept down most of the time. The decoration is pretty basic. It's not the &quot;friendliest&quot; hotel room you are going to be staying in.The bathroom was spartan but big. The toiletries were fine and there was plenty of towels. The toilet was in a room across the bath and interestingly there's one door that was the door for the toilet and the living room, which was a bit weird.There's a restaurant downstairs that served up a tasty if limited continental breakfast. The staff very very courteous and friendly.\",\n",
       " \"Hotel Godin is a beautiful full service hotel, on the level of perhaps a Westin, but slightly less expensive. The interiors are very interesting, with muted colors and bare concrete. I could have used a bit more light in the guestrooms. But service was great and you certainly can't beat the location right on St. Laurent. Underground parking is available, but PRICEY at 25 CAN a night.\",\n",
       " 'Excellent hotel. Pay no mind to the Internet naysayers who say that this was missing or that that was terrible or whatever. This place was excellent, the staff and service was excellent, and I would stay here again in a heartbeat. Highly recommended.',\n",
       " \"We stayed at the Hotel Godin for the Montreal International Jazz Festival, and chose it for its great location (only 2 blocks from the festival, and a few blocks from Rue St. Denis) and its mod styling. The lobby and lounge area are cool, and you can enjoy free espresso and free wireless internet access. There is also a bar in the lobby that is open until 11pm. The rooms are cool and have a nice minimalist styling, and the ceilings are poured concrete with builder notations scribbled on them (which we thought was cool). The beds are very comfortable, and you will find a free newspaper outside your room each morning. The finish isn't quite up to par with other mod-styled hotels like the W, but it's also a little less expensive. The staff are very friendly. There is a club/ lounge/ bar downstairs, but it didn't seemed to be open during our stay. Also, plan on having breakfast elsewhere, unless you've always wanted to try a $25 omelette (check out La Brioche Lyonnaise on St. Denis for some good local breakfast grub).\",\n",
       " \"A very nice, stylish hotel that tries its best to nickel and dime you to death. Granted, this is increasingly common in today's world of travel, but, when you pay $250 a night for a room, you'd think they'd throw in a bottle of water or internet access.Water is $2.50 a small bottle. Although they're free in the workout room, which is nearly always empty. Internet access is $10 a day, something that's not mentioned in any of the hotel literature. There is FREE wireless access in the lobby, but they always keep the techno-music blaring (even at 4 a.m.). A glass of wine in the lobby is $12. Champagne $24.Staff is helpful but typically dense in a young person sort of way. Room pricing is all over the chart depending on where you look. In May, the Hotel Godin website listed rooms at $279. Travelocity had the same room for $225. Expedia had it at $179.All that said, The Godin is conveniently located and nicely run, but you'll come away with the sense that you've been ripped off even though you've probably had a great time.\",\n",
       " \"The hotel's location is second to none. Close to downtown, the village, Saint Laurent night life, underground city and all major attractions Montreal has to offer. The room was super comfortable, a mixture of old features that made a bold statement (i.e. the ceiling was unfinished, yet the decor of the room was stylish and didn't sacrifice comfort). The bathroom was spacious and super clean. Service is definitely key, we were given directions to everything, and the staff always went above and beyond the call of duty to our every need. Will definitely be back.\",\n",
       " \"Went to Montreal this past weekend with a girlfriend! we loved the Godin. Room 240 was gorgeous, the bathroom unbelievable! As other reviews mentioned, lighting was a bit of an issue. If you don't mind noise, then the hotel location wont bother you. Street noise is really load. Not the hotels fault just the location. If you want to be in the action, this is perfect. Service was fair, depending on who you get I suppose. i called for a saftey pin, and the girl I spoke to was wonderful! Then I went to Front desk to let them now our A/C wasn't turning on , and she didn't really care at all. Everything in Montreal is extremely laid back anyways. We found service to be slow everywhere we went. Overall I would stay at this hotel again.\",\n",
       " \"We stayed for a weekend in cold, snowy February. Booked two rooms. The hotel is overpriced for the service levels - we've since been in the Fairmont Queen Elizabeth and it is sooo much better. Go to another hotel - plenty of better choices within the price range, and while the location is good, so are most locations in Montreal - it is a liveable city!1) Valet parking were NOT friendly, access is difficult on busy Sherbrooke if a car or two are already &quot;dropping off&quot; guests - there was quite a mistake with the valets and it ended up on a double billing at the end of the stay. ... that would have been a pardonable mistake but...2) No coffee or cookies in the lobby, despite them being advertised on both the website and the hotel brochures. Cold light-couloured brew was sitting for hours... no amenities of that sort in-room (no coffee maker basics)3) Rooms look and feel rather drab than &quot;chic&quot;, and the dark colours only seem to mask the dirt. However, I agree that the bed/ mattress was firm and linen pleasant.4) Poor sound insulation between walls - we shared the next-door neighbours &quot;sweet valentine&quot; exploits - I must say we got jealous! Unfortunately it didn't help us get sleep...5) The restaurant wasn't open and part of the hotel was &quot;under construction&quot; - yet they still dared to charge full-price...poor.Overall I would not go back to this hotel, it is overpriced and the level of service and overall &quot;feeling&quot; isn't up to snuff for what they charge or for what they presume to be. Plenty of better choices in Montreal.\",\n",
       " \"The Godin is a very modern spin on a boutique hotel. Lots of glass, chrome and dark colours. If you don't see beauty in different shades of grey then this hotel isn't for you. It is fair to say that the rooms and the lounges could do with more light - suffice to say that the bare concrete ceiling (it was supposed to be like that) in the room didn't have a light fitting in it. Nevertheless, the hotel is well appointed and the decor is tatsteful and eventually grows on you.The lobby has free wireless internet and an expresso machine. If you time it right you get free cakes as well! Staff are friendly and if you speak kindly to the maids they will you extra chocolates when they turn your bed down!Location is good, very close to lots of restaurants and bars on Rue St Laurent. However, the metro stations are a couple of blocks away.Overall, an enjoyable experience in a classy city hotel.\",\n",
       " \"I've stayed twice at the Hotel Godin, in September 2005 and October 2006. The first stay was amazing. The second stay was decent. The pluses during both stays were the perfect location; the quality of the bed, shower and amenities; and the friendliness and efficiency of the staff. What made the second stay less positive was the decline in value. During the first stay, free bottled water was available in the lobby and the room, a continental breakfast was included in the room rate, and front of the line passes to restaurant/clubs owned by the Godin owners were given out to guests. By the time of the second stay majority ownership had changed and all these were no longer available. So the Hotel Godin is a decent hotel and if you like modern hotels and want to be close to nightlife and good restaurants and a reasonable walk away from the Latin Quarter, Chinatown, and the touristy old town, you'll enjoy a stay there.\",\n",
       " \"First impression was &quot;where is the doorman or bellman?!?!&quot;. I had lots of luggage and trying to cart it in the slushy side walk by myself. People at the front desk saw that and didn't help! I would understand if they were busy with guests but both were just standing there chatting away. The rooms were very dark. I loved the bathroom except just like the bedroom it was dark, I suggest ladies to apply make up in front of the window! Based on their website I thought they would still have Fresh products. There seemed to be a recent change in amenities to Gilcrhrist &amp; Soames, such a shame... Continental breakfast served downstairs was very good. I almost wanted to ask what bakery bakes their bread! Service was very good too. I loved the location. Close to fantastic restaurants and a couple of trendy stores. I can imagine staying at this hotel in the summer would be fantastic.\",\n",

       " \"My girlfriend and I stayed at the Godin over Christmas for 4 days. The hotel was great. Its location on Sherbrooke and St. Laurent was in the center of the great restaurants and bars. The decor was ultra-modern and the prices of in-room services followed that. Room service was ridiculous... $25-$35 entrees. Breakfast for ONE person cost us $25. This could be temporary, since the hotel's restaurant and bar is not yet open.Apart from that, we felt like we were staying in a hotel that was much more expensive than what we actually paid. Hotel + Flight from NYC was $500 each for 4 nights. I would definitely recommend this hotel. Ask for Jean-Pierre at the concierge.. he was extremely helpful and accomodating.\",\n",
       " \"Hotel Godin was a great stay! Like everyone else has pretty much said, the rooms are a bit dark BUT, the rooms were clean and the furniture was chic and modern. I felt very comfortable staying. Also, the staff was absolutely friendly and helpful! They suggested places for my boyfriend and I to eat. From the manager to the bellboy(especially the bellboy), everyone was absolutely interested in making sure that my boyfriend and I had everything from reservations to directions. I can't rave enough about this place. Maybe my boyfriend and I got really lucky in meeting all the right staff but we really loved the whole staff/room/hotel itself. The location is really great too because its right on the corner of two major streets of Montreal! you are just walking distance of SO many clubs/restaurants/shops!It's a shame that this hotel has so much potential. They couldn't get their liquor license so there is this HUGE space for where the restaurant should be...along with the bar. Because of this, hotel Godin is a hidden GEM! My boyfriend and I will most definitely go back! Thank you to other trip advisors who contribute!\",\n",
       " \"What a let down! Hotel Godin is overrated. On the plus side, it is new, well located and clean. However, most of the rooms do not have bath; rooms are dark; when you lay down on the bed and look at the ceiling you would think that you are sleeping in the parking garage (no paint, no ceiling, just ciment!). Good luck if you want to shave or put make up in the washroom...it is so dark....The service was poor. It called itself a boutique-hotel...it is not. Don't bother. Go elsewhere.\",\n",

       " \"Situated on the corner of St Laurent and Sherbrooke, there is no better location than the Godin to begin a night on the town. The rooms and lobby are well designed, with the ambiance of a locally owned boutique hotel. The clientele is exactly what you want to see (no cheesy corporate types!). The staff are friendly and helpful. On a lesser note, I am tired of the nickel and diming the better hotels are charging for internet access. It should be free, and at the Godin, it's overpriced. In the past, the staff encouraged me to have breakfast for free, yet on my last trip, after having my breakfast, I was charged, and told that they now charge the guests (it would've been nice to know before eating a banana and a croissant for $14).  Regardless, I much prefer the Godin to the W, as it is a true Montreal establishment that seems to be waiting to flourish, as a major nightclub/hotel phenomenon. I believe it will. And as I said, the location is perfect for enjoying the nightlife.\",\n",

I had heard of the Hotel Godin but now after having experienced it I will definitely go back. Everyone was very professional - the service was friendly - I loved the lounge area in the lobby and the european style breakfast. Very modern and clean. Great location as you are able to walk almost anywhere downtown Montreal. Very safe area with lots of trendy restaurants and bars.

       " \"We had booked a last minute trip to Montreal Aug 5-7, '06. 1/2 business 1/2 pleasure. Having heard of a 100+ room boutique hotel in the downtown area, we thought it was worth a try. What a refreshing experience. From the cool music, chic and smooth lobby, to the well dressed employees, I haven't felt more welcomed in a hotel in years. The room was a little larger than a standard size with dark purples and greys-very different. Black tiles in the bathroom with a glass shower and funky sinks. Every hallway we walked down there was a staff member that smiled.It was within walking distantce-15 minutes to Old Montreal where was a bounty of great restaruants and cafes. Up the street is Sofia's for a great bowl of Goat cheese ravioli and bottle of Vino. A little expensive...but worth it. We went the the hotel restaurant for breakfast which was bright and airy-the server had the sliding doors open to the street. My most pleasant surprise was when we came back to the room both nights and found the room turned down, ice in the buckets, curtains drawn and a treat of chocolates on the pillow. Very welcoming as our feet were sore from walking all day. Didn't find a pool as I dont think they had one. Some planned reno's attachd to the builing are apparently for a banquet hall. I'm glad we went out of our way to try it. Too often we stay at the same chains and are tired of it. Too bad about the taxi's-I've never been for whiplashed so bad coming back from the casino last night. LAstly, go for the espresso in the lobby...\",\n",

Great location for shopping &amp; dining.',\n",
       " \"Uninformed reviews appear to put the Godin at the head of the pack of Montreal's trendy boutique hotel market. Clearly, those reviewers haven't experienced the Godin firsthand. Service is terrible; the concierge consistently screwed up our dinner reservations, the front desk was alerted about luggage arriving from the airport and we asked them to phone the room when it arrived, but no one ever did.On top of all of that, the Godin's supposed &quot;pluses&quot; were conspicously absent. Cool bar? Nope, not open. Restaurant? Closed. Wireless internet? Not in the rooms, and wired internet access available for a hefty $13 a night. The room keys got demagnetized on a regular basis. Not to mention very dark rooms which, even with all the lights turned on, were still dank and depressing (rather than &quot;trendy&quot;) at night, even during the day.I stayed at the St-Paul just two months prior and for the same price there is no comparison. The St-Paul had a charming staff, which were HELPFUL, not to mention a fully licensed bar and restaurant, beautiful rooms, free internet access, and character missing from the Godin.The Godin had one factor which set it apart from the other boutique hotels in a good way - its location on St-Laurent and Sherbrooke (rather than in the ubiquitous Old Port like every other boutique hotel) made the Plateau, Mile End, Downtown, Old Port and the Village accessible by easy walk. Too bad the hotel is so disappointing!\",\n",
       " \"My boyfriend and I stayed at Hotel Godin from June 30 to July 4. We paid about $215 a night plus $25 a night for parking.LocationIt is definitely better to be in this part of town instead of Old Montreal. Old Montreal is beautiful but it's a place for tourists and does not feel like a real, vibrant city. Godin's neighborhood, Plateau Mont Royal, is half cool and half lame. Unfortunatley Godin is closer to the lame half but is sitll closer to the good half than any hotel i know of. The bad half is Ste Laurent, the street next to the hotel which is often referred to as &quot;trendy&quot; and &quot;cool.&quot; I may be a jaded New Yorker, but i found most of Ste. Laurent to be cheesy and soulless. All the restaurants were playing bad house music and were filled with tacky furniture. But don't be discouraged. The cool half of the Plateau is just a few blocks further to the corner of Duluth and Dorlet streets. This area has beautiful parks and residential architecture. The restaurants were sophisticated, authentic, and had great food. I especially recommend L'Express and Laloux. ServiceEveryone we encountered was friendly and professional. The concierge wasn't around too often but the people at the reception desk were always able to answer our questions. RoomThe room is VERY dark. It's even hard to read unless it's daylight and the shades are up. It was frustrating that there was no translucent curtains that would allow light in but not allow people to see in. The bed was very comfortable and the bathroom was slick but usable.Food/DrinksThe hotel is not finished yet. There is no sign of construction but large portions of the hotel are empty and unused for no apparent reason. The hotel also doesn't seem to have a liquor license or serve dinner. This wasn't a big factor for us but would be a huge turn-off for someone traveling alone who wanted to meet people in the hotel. The place was a ghost town except during the free breakfast (which was very good).\",\n",
       " \"My partner and I stayed at the Godin over the July 4th weekend. We decided to come up from New York to check out Montreal. We didn't find the city to our liking (too many depressing buildings and tacky-ness.) The people were blankly nice, but not overwhelming helpful. It seemed as though nobody had any enthusiasm for their own city. This extended to the staff at the Godin. There was no attempt made to help us out in terms of discovering the city. There was no knowledgable concierge on hand to make recommendations. And St. Laurent St.....sad little clubs and gaudy restaurants. not very hip.We bought a bottle of Vodka and holed up on our bed (which is super-comfy) and padded around the nice room. The shower DOES blow though. It's not for tall people and the water pressure is terrible. The room service menu is way overpriced for such a low-rent place. I think it was 24 bucks for a burger.The overall interior design of the hotel is college modern art museum meets new college dorm complex. there is way too much space. no intimacy. aside from a few Ligne Roset lamps in lobby, there is nothing here to shout about. the breakfast room is inversely large in proportion to the selection of food there (no meat, sad little croissants, limited fresh fruit)The exterior of the hotel is pretty joyless as well. Right across from an Esso station. Like an office building. It's not a site to behold and make you think &quot;great....we are at our hotel&quot;.We stumbled through Jazzfest one day. Such a blight. Spilling from St. Catherine to that horrible Place de la Artes. Concrete drabness. Badly dressed people. Soprano Sax....We left the hotel as early as possible and hung out at the airport all day.\",\n",
       " \"Just spent two wonderful nights at the Godin this past week. This is a very cool, comfortable hotel with a location that cannot be beat at the corner of Sherbrooke and St. Laurent.Best Things:- Super comfortable beds- Large Bathrooms with fogless mirrors- Fresh bath products- Complimentary breakfast in the bar- Cool lobby with mood lighting at nightThings to Improve:- Bar is not open yet but will be soon- No restaurant (maybe next year)The bar and restaurant situation is not a big deal considering some of Montreal's best restaurants and bars are a 2.5 minute walk from the hotel (check out Time Cafe, Madonna did when I was there) The staff was very attentive and helpful, and had lots of suggestions for restaurants and things to do. My room was super quiet with a nice mix of materials: wood, carpet and a concrete ceiling. I can't wait to go back to Montreal and when I do I will be staying at Hotel Godin.\",\n",
       " \"Before I arrived somebody told me it was a wannabee hotel. It was only after my arrival I understood what he meant. This hotel wants to be fancy but it isn't. It wants to be trendy but it isn't. It is build with cheap materials, has no isolation and if you look very carefully it is actually very poor. To make everything worse it is ran by people that apparently have no experience in the hotel business. It misses the class and charm of a good hotel and scores zero when it comes to service. Can you imagine a breakfast room with no coffee spoons around? Can you imagine the sprinkler of the shower mounted to low on the wall so you can not properly shower? can you imagine to wake up by people going to the bathroom in the room above (you think that a complete bathtub is falling on your head)? Can you imagine people from the reception not calling you back after you called them with a specific request? Only looking at the rates you realise why they actually &quot;want to be&quot;. Unfortunately they aren't and the next time I will stay as before at Le Germain. Probably one of the best hotels and not only in Montral...\",\n",
       " \"As a travel writer, who has stayed from 5-star hotels to youth hostels, I don't expect too much from my accommodations besides a comfy bed and warm shower. Until, that is, I stayed at Le Godin in Montreal, Canada. Besides the trendy lobby, chic rooms and beautiful staff (which I have seen from New York City to Bombay), there was only one very special feature which really made my stay there unforgettable. Only one thing that spoiled me beyond any other hotel I've stayed at. It was the hotel's star concierge, Anna.As I am always travelling to cities for one or two days at a time, nights spent alone eating room service is common practice. When Anna found out that this was my first trip to Montreal and that I was there on my own, she went out of her way to make a full-day itinerary for me, covering day trips to museums and shopping, to the nightlife of eateries and clubs. She explained, and truthfully, that Montreal was a city to be experienced at all hours. She even made sure to call all the places I was visiting ahead of time to let them know that I was coming and to treat her guest exceptionally well. She even passed by to see me during dinner to make sure that my day had gone well. It had, and very well in fact. As soon as I was back home, I booked another trip back to Montreal in 2 months time.Well, was I shocked to learn that upon arrival in Montreal, Anna was no longer working at Le Godin. What's more, her entire position had been eliminated. A concierge was deemed as &quot;not necessary&quot; at this chic hotel, where clients expect a high level of service (as confessed by one of the remaining staff). Long gone is the specialized attenton to each customer. Long gone is the much-needed advice and suggestions offered on the beautiful city of Montreal. Long gone are the kind words and pleasant smiles of Anna. It is safe to say that my second trip to Montreal fell far short of my first visit. This second encounter has not soured my taste for Montreal, but the same can't be true for Le Godin. Without Anna, this boutique hotel falls short on all points, especially customer service. The new management, which swept in and eliminated Anna and her position, has buried itself in quick sand. As a travel writer, whose job it is to make recommendations on where to stay in international cities, I am stating to you, as I did to my colleagues, family and friends, save yourself the trouble of bad service and foolish management and don't stay at Le Godin. The Comfort Inn would be a better bet, in my opinion. My mission, since the day I found out that Anna was no longer at this hotel, is to find her and take all my business to her new employer. Stay tuned for my next entry... I'll let you know where this jewel of a concierge is hiding.\",\n",
       " \"The Godin is designed as a cool, boutique style (read dark wood, polished concrete and fresh white linen) hotel, and it works on that level. The reception area is airy and welcoming, but we had read about the famous 'in room check in' and there was no sign of it despite the hotel not being too busy. The rooms are spacious with really comfortable beds, but no tea or coffee facilities and the wireless access didn't work in my room.Breakfast is pretty good - toast, cheese, fruit, fresh bread and pastries - but the bran muffins weren't at all tasy and they frequently ran out of coffee, juice and eggs through not topping up often enough. There's a funky looking bar and sound system, and a terrace where you can take breakfast.Now for the downside - they 'forgot' to collect my dry cleaning before the 9am deadline (despite my calling down) and as a result I had to chase to get my still dirty clothes returned before checking out the next day. No acceptable apology from housekeeping, although the guy who returned them was clearly embarrassed. My Canadian clients had arranged for a gift to be in our room on arrival, and it wasn't delivered to the room until 11.30pm at night. Having just got off a UK flight, it wasn't fun to be woken up by unsolicted room service! Finally - and importantly - they have no alcohol license! No-one in the hotel mentions it, either when booking or when you're there, but there's only a soft drink mini bar and no way of purchasing wine, beer, anything. My Canadian clients informed me that the owners couldn't get a license, and that it was a bit of a standing joke accross the city that this cooler than cool hotel was dry!All in it's a nice hotel, but service isn't quite right yet and they should really be telling people about the bar absence. You've been warned.....!\",\n",
       " 'I was bumped to the Hotel Godin for a conference I was attending at the Congress Center. It is not really close to the Palais de Congrais/Congress Center. I think you need to be a person who likes this type of hotel to enjoy it. Good points: The beds are VERY comfortable thought. The staff is nice as well.Bad points: The walls in the bedroom are dark grey to light black. Everything in the hotel is various shades of grey. I found it depressing and hard to see in the room at night. No coffee maker, no iron, no lobby store if you forget something. I dont think Id stay there again as it was to dark for my liking.',\n",

We stayed in the basic room with kng size bed, which was spacious, airy, superbly designed, and wonderfuly comfortable. The included continental breakfast was great, and the espresso machine in the lobby with complimentary pound cake was a welcome sight after a long trip The staff were all utterly gracious, competent, and helpful. Add to this the perfect location, and we'll definitely be back over and over and over again.\",\n",

I came with my best friend the other weekend and adored the room, the service (the concierge is the best thing that ever happened to us!) and the overall ambience. We partied all night at the Globe Restaurant down the street and had a great time. The next morning, the breakfast was the perfect hangover cure. It was the best I've seen at a hotel so far.For two girls who work in fashion publishing from New York, this hotel was a perfect answer for a few fabulous nights of partying in Montreal. I would think it to be Montreal's SoHo Grand or maybe the Mercer...its in a really trendy area that seemed to be close to everything that was worth seeing.\",\n",
       " \"Our room was exceedingly stylish. Attention to details such as creative lighting, a very comfortable bed, dark warm colours for winter mixed with large mirrors and windows for light, all contributed a very balanced and comfortable -not to mention aesthetically pleasing- interior. We wish the bathroom had a bathtub and not just a (albeit beautiful) shower: it's cold in Montreal and we would have liked to immerse ourselves to thaw. We got a good deal on the hotel room online and so price versus quality was really quite astounding at the Godin: that is one reason we rate this hotel excellent and not simply above average. The service at the hotel was discreet (in a European invisible hand way) and very helpful when we asked for advice on Montreal life and where to go out. The location is excellent. We especially enjoyed two nearby restaurants: Au Pied de Cochon and L'Express. It's worth mentioning that the Godin feels a little unfinished -partly because their bar has not yet opened: it is a beautiful space. I hope it's open next time we're in Montreal -we'll be staying at the Godin.\",\n",
       " 'Wanted to stay at a boutique hotel in Montreal with my significant other - lots of choice of course, but wanted good value as well. Found Hotel Godin at $140/night for Friday and Saturday night which seemed like a steal and read great things about the history and design of the hotel and rooms.The positives:- Good amenities in the room: nice bathrobes, modern flat screen TV (24&quot;)- Decor was very modern / trendy with deep colors, but still comfortable- Privilege (standard) room was large enough and comfortableThe negatives:- Service was hit-or-miss. Half the time there was no bellman at the door and we had to wait / look for him. Also the staff did not respond to a request for additional towels and glasses, claiming that &quot;the hotel was quite busy&quot;. All in all, staff could have been friendlier, but service was not terrible- Lighting in the rooms is not great, as others have mentionedOverall, we were quite happy with the stay. It is a hotel with quite a lot of style. In fact, I would say that the rooms have a similar style to those at a W Hotel.',\n",
       " 'As a first-time tourist to Montreal, all I can say is thank you to Hotel Godin for making my stay so absolutely fabulous. When I had first thought about vacationing in Montreal, I was planning on staying at one of the bigger hotel chains, such as the Holiday Inn or the Sheraton. But then I saw an advertisement of Hotel Godin in a magazine, and decided to go for a more intimate experience. I am so happy I did so! The rooms are stylish, the location to restaurants and nightlife is phenomenal... But the most impressive part of my experience was the staff. After speaking with the concierge and the front-desk staff, I abandoned my pre-arranged schedule of must-see tourist sites, and listened to their suggestions instead. They were able to tell me about events and places to visit that I never would have found on my own. Friendly, knowledgeable and generous, everyone at Hotel Godin went above and beyond in providing me with the best service. I will definitely come back to Montreal in the future, and the only hotel I would ever consider staying at is the Hotel Godin.',\n",
       " \"This hotel is very beautiful and has a lot of potential, but........ The doorman &quot;forgot&quot; to bring our luggage to our room after we checked in, whenever we wanted a tea or coffee from the lounge there were no clean mugs or water (and there were certainly no nibblies either), our internet connection and the pay movie channels were not set up for us leading to 30 minute wait, lightbulbs were burnt out in one of the lamps, the mini-bar was broken and wouldn't open, no wine glasses, corkscrew, iron, or ironing board in room, hard time getting a hold of reception or valet service, and a few times the doorman just stood near the door looking at us (without opening the door)as we were entering the hotel leading to an awkward entrance LOL. It got to the point where we were never surpised when something went wrong. Seems like they took staff from their restaurants to run the hotel.That said, the room and bathroom, although dark, were very clean and nice, the breakfast was great, we loved the &quot;Fresh&quot; toilletries, the location is excellent, and the gym is nice touch. I realize that the things I am complaining about are very menial (I'm by no means a princess), but you expect a certain amount of service and attention to detail when you are staying at a hotel such as this. I would not stay there again only because I have stayed at what is considered their competition (many of them) and had better service.........and I could see myself in their bathroom mirrors!).\",\n",

We had one disappointment when after two peaceful evenings the neighbouring room was occupied by a couple of very noisy women - waking us up in the early hours on their return from clubbing! We did complain to reception and they moved us to another room.Breakfast was excellent with a varied choice of cereal, fruit, bread, pastries, tea, coffee and fruit juice. An endless supply of bottled water was available and if you are able to return to the hotel late afternoon, small nibbles are supplied with tea and coffee in the reception.We found the staff to be polite and helpful and would stay here on a return trip to the City. It is in an excellent location for exploring the city and the old town is only a short walk away.',\n",

The staff was pleasant and helpful. Breakfast was yummy with french pastry, fruit and cheese. The only thing I wasn't keen on was how dark things were. The lighting to the lower level bathrooms was so dark you had to run your hand on the walls so you knew where you were going. Otherwise the visit was fun.\",\n",
       " \"Three friends and I stayed at Hotel Godin for three nights. I would echo the broad theme laid out by all the other reviewers: superb location, attentive/professional service, great rooms, no restaurant/bar yet, stylish, access to trendy bar/lounge/restaurant clubs. Location: the corner of Sherbrooke and St. Laurent turns out to be really a very central location. It is 1 - 15 minutes away from the Latin Quarter, the Village, Chinatown. While we walked to the Old Port area -- most people will probably want to take the Metro or taxi. However, the Old Port area was incredibly touristy -- the equivalent of Times Square in New York City. Sherbrooke and St. Laurent was the equivalent of Tribeca/Soho in New York City. Lots of interesting restaurants, micro-breweries, lounges, clubs and bars -- mostly attended by locals of various ages and interests. We were 5 minutes walk to Schwartz Deli -- which is Montreal's very effective response to New York's Katz's Deli. Hotel service: The four of us came from all over the U.S. at various time. The hotel staff was very careful to remember our preferences, arrival times and helped us coordinate. After we had already &quot;used&quot; our rooms (towels, etc.), we had decided to get two adjoining rooms -- the hotel staff looked into it and immediately accomodated us. While I usually find it extremely creepy staying at hotels where the staff is better looking and better dressed/groomed than the guests, Hotel Godin was the rare exception where everyone was really friendly. Great rooms: Stylish rooms with great bathrooms. The beds were extremely comfortable. LCD tv. Endless flow of free bottled water. Only complaint I would have was the rooms were a little dark and there was no bath tub. As others have mentioned, there was extremely nice space for a bar and restaurant, but they were not opened. I really hope they get to open them soon.Access to restaurants: Montreal has a few restaurants that turn into dance clubs as the night progresses -- a very neat and fun concept. As we were going to various bars, the bartenders mentioned a couple of places to us: Gogo Lounge (not a strip club!), Myst, Cafe Buona Notte, Globe, Time Supper Club. We went to three of these. It turned out Buona Notte, Globe and Time Supper Club were all owned by Godin. There were huge lines of very beautiful people everywhere, but to my huge surprise (being a cynical New Yorker) the doormen escorted us in at the very front right away at every place when we mentioned we were from Godin.Overall, great experience at Godin (and Montreal). We got a phenomenal price through Expedia ($165/night) but I would be willing to pay a lot more when I come back to Montreal again during Jazz fest. I only hope we can get a room then.\",\n",
       " 'A fun hotel with friendly staff in a hip area. It would be nice if there was a bar - but the extensive complimentary breakfast made up for it! The gym is small, but really all you need for vacation.',\n",

       " \"I've never written one of these reviews before, but after my stay at the Hotel Godin, I felt compelled to. My husband and I just spent two nights there. We usually stay in the Loews Vogue, and have stayed in the Residence Inn downtown. The location of this hotel and the quality of service both make it better than the others. Hotel: At the Vogue, I've encountered plenty of snobbiness (maybe because my husband and I are young; I don't know). At the Hotel Godin, everyone was incredibly friendly from the moment I checked in until the moment I checked out. The Privilege King is a great room; ask for a room with a tub--it's very deep and plenty of room for two. The King bed is so comfortable; the pillows are incredibly soft. There is not a lot of counter space in the bathroom (none really--you have to improvise with the little stand next to the sink). The toilet is in a separate small room from the Shower and tub, which is a good idea. Even though I think the hotel was fairly crowded, it felt like we were the only ones in the entire hotel. It was quiet (except I could hear very late-night revelers outside my 4th floor window, but I didn't care). My laptop didn't pick up a wireless signal, but we purchased it through the TV for 9.95 for 24 hours. Neither the bar nor the restaurant is currently open (as of 9/18). The free breakfast is nice--fruits, cereals, breads, assorted cheeses, croissants, etc. Parking is 24 (CAD). Location: half a block from Rue St. Laurent, with plenty of non-tourist trap restaurants (unlike those restaurants surrounding the area of Loews and the Residence Inn). Maestro SVP was a great seafood bistro; we also ate at Pizzedelic. You hear French a lot more in this area of Montreal, but everyone we encountered spoke English as well. I just arrived home, and I'm already looking into staying there in November. My husband and I had a fantastic time there. I've never encountered a nicer staff. Not even a hint of snobbery. Tip: book thru expedia, as it seems they have the best rates (a lot cheaper than my quotes from orbitz or the hotel). You will not regret staying here!\",\n",
       " \"Lets get this straight  Overall, the hotel is lovely and modern - like a photo spread from Wallpaper. (If you dont know what Wallpaper is, you probably will not appreciate the dcor and should take particular note of the following paragraphs).The moment I walked in to the hotel, I appreciated what the owners were trying to do and I was very comfortable. However, the hotel holds itself out as being in a very select league and when you play in the big leagues.well, you know.From reading the hotel website, I had a certain picture in my mind  that expectation was not met. I was hoping for a boutique modern Schrager-esque hotel run like a Swiss watch  that did not happen.The Hotel Godin in a brief description: A modern Schrager-esque hotel run like my grandpas railroad watchWhile the spits and putters of the hotel (and my mixed metaphors) did not destroy the experience - I would say that this wine is being served before its time and the hotel needs to breathe a little before I come back.A few issues:Under-staffedUnder-soundproofed for street noiseNo bar. No liquor license.No restaurant.Don't let the website fool you - just Google &quot;liquor license and Hotel Godin&quot; and you will see that after putting $30 million in renovations, the owners of the hotel have not been permitted to obtain a liquor license - because their other properties have a history of liquor-law violations.So while you can go to the W and lounge and party in the lobby bar and eat in the hotel's restaurant - at the Godin you are stuck with empty space.For some people that would be fine - they like peace and quiet....But please note where this Hotel is located. The corner of Sherbrooke and St. Laurent is ground-zero for nightlife (think Rush and Division in Chicago) and if you did not know that before you stayed in the hotel - you will know the first night when the horn honking and drunken revelry sings through your windows.The positive side of location, location, location is that you can walk to an assortment of cafes, coffee houses, restaurants, bars and wander back home to the Hotel Godin with no fear of getting lost - you are truly in the middle of the action.The downside of the lively street life is that when the lights go out and before the Xanax kicks in, if you close your eyes really hard, it still sounds like you have camped-out in the hotels backyard (or you left the windows open).I am not sure if I slept for more than one uninterrupted hour at a time due to the noise.The next problem.. strike that: the next issue....the staff. Let me clarify: The staff is wonderful!! Nice, suave, polite, etc... The problem is the &quot;understaff&quot; - you see because the hotel is not fully up-and-running - the hotel is severely understaffed.As frequent Montreal travelers know - there is a flat fee from the airport for transport to the city. About $30 for a taxi and $50 for a limo (Town Car). The limo driver got lost because for some reason no taxi driver or limo driver knows about the hotel - the point is: We were dropped off on the side of the hotel and stood outside for 10 minutes waiting for someone to help us with the bags - there was no one &quot;on duty&quot;. We schlepped all of the bags inside to reception and had to lug our bags to our room. The nice reception lady (girl) was about 5' tall and weighed 100 lbs wet  Do you think I was going to ask her to carry the bags?? Even if she had offered - which she didn't - I was not going to play the colonial governor, so I lugged all of the bags myself.Later in the stay, doormen sporadically appeared, a wonderful concierge appeared and overall the experience was wonderful....Wonderful but &quot;one-off&quot; - and until they get their act completely together I am going back to the W. With all that aside however, the hotel is really ABOVE-average, but it is not excellent.... and I am afraid that with this price-point only the excellent survive.\",\n",
       " \"close to airport and easy access to downtown. very clean and staff is very helpfull. Good Wi Fi included and good breakfast included in price. Parking at $9 per day is excessive. Overall an OK place to stay short term. a bit too expensive compared to comparable hotels in the area. Hard to access if you are not familiar with the ridiculous traffic circle within a traffic circle road set up. The city of Dorval and the airport authority really need to get it together and try to make things user friendly re signage &amp; access.

The trick to getting to the hotel if you are driving is to immediately turn off of the roundabout and turn right into the Best Western parking lot. Go to the left and drive behind the parking lot. This will lead you to the front of the Fairfield. My husband and I drove this roundabout twice until we got it right! Self parking fee of $8 CAD (plus tax) with in-out privileges. If you don't want a room facing the rain line, then say so. We stayed in Room 917 for 2 nights and Loved it. Nice sized room. The beds are comfortable, the halls are well lit and bright and carpet is very clean. The bathroom was very clean, too. There is some airplane noise, but this is an airport hotel. Did not hear the trains from our room, but knew there were communter train tracks next to the hotel. Free Wireless Internet. If you do not bring a laptop, there are 2 computers in the business section for guest use. Enjoyed the unlimited continental breakfast that included bacon, egg and cheese quesadillas and waffles. Breakfast ends at 9:30am. Breakfast area is not busy, but it would depend on when you go to eat breakfast. There are two washers and dryers in the on-site laundry room so you can do your own laundry.Hotel is about 20 minute drive to Centre-ville/Downtown Montreal, located right off of the autoroute/highway. I highly recommend this hotel.\",\n",
       " \"First off, this is a nice little hotel near the Pierre Elliot Trudeau Airport, and right beside the train tracks. The hotel was ready in May 2008, and it's gorgeous. Its still very very clean. My girlfriend and I stayed there for a weekend getaway, and we loved it. As for other reviewers complaining about certain things, here's what we think. Yes, the hotel is a terrible location. The trick to get to the hotel is to cut through the Best Western's hotel parking lot, across the street. AS for noise levels, we had our room facing towards the front side away from the train. We had no problems sleeping, nor could we complain about the outside noise. However, we do suspect that people may have suffered louder noise if their rooms faced the train. Request to have a front faced room, and this will solve your problems. My girlfriend's a light sleeper and she had no problems sleeping.The staff was friendly and helpful (they gave us nice info with places to eat, close by, and they provided a map). Rooms were very clean, and their was even a nice little pool. Also, there was a small workout room too. Continental breakfast was delicious, with the Belgium Waffles. &quot;Come for the Waffles, stay for the beds&quot;.We did have one little problem and that was that the tub didn't drain correctly unless the drain tab was lifted. No biggie, as we used an elastic band to get us through. We're sure the staff would have done something had we mentioned it.Parking was cheap at 6 bucks a day, but we noticed some noise from other patrons, but not much. The rooms are fairly sound proofed, but not completely. None of them really are anyways, regardless of which hotel you stay at.Overall:Pros: -Good rates for clean rooms-Continental Breakfast-Clean pool and workout area-Sturdy Beds-Cheap parking-LCD TV (Where did this come from?!? lol)-Friendly and helpful staffCons:-Terrible location-Hard to find-Eating area is pretty small-Breakfast area ends at 10, and usually has a line\",\n",
       " \"Booked this hotel after reading the reviews posted here. Most of them are spot-on: the hotel is right next to a major rail line, so make sure your room heating/AC unit is set to &quot;Fan On&quot; if you are a light sleeper, as this will reduce the extra noise when trains roll past.The hotel has an indoor pool - that's something my two kids always prefer, no matter the season. It's smallish but still decent.The free continental breakfast was slightly above average; the usual assortment of breads, cereals, juices, coffee/tea, plus a waffle maker. The hotel was nearly or entirely full during our stay, so the breakfast room was packed 3 of the 5 mornings we were there.The hotel's location is a plus if you're using the airport. If you're instead spending most of your time downtown, the hotel is a tad remote. However, you can leave your car and take public transit ($2.75 per trip as of 8/08) - by catching the 211 or 221 Express bus at the Dorval train station (a 200 ft walk from the hotel) to the Lionel-Groulx Metro stop (Green line) and then taking the Metro into town -- a published trip time of 32 minutes). We only discovered this option on the last day so couldn't take advantage of it. See http://www.stm.info for more details; use the STM trip planner (&quot;Tous Azimuts&quot;...both in English and French) to build a schedule. Both that bus line and metro operate past midnight.Parking costs $8 per day, unlimited in/out privileges. Make sure to have your room key card encoded for parking lot use, or you'll have to request a key code in person every time you want to exit -- that can be a hassle if the front desk is busy.As others have said, the hotel is hard to get to the first time you try -- it's on a one-way street and you merge onto that street just PAST the hotel entrance, so you have to loop around.If you type in '700 Avenue Michel Jasmin&quot; (the hotel's address) into an online map service (Google Maps or the one at the Fairfield website) you can see what I mean; the directions those services provide are accurate.I found the hotel staff overall very helpful. Would stay there again.\",\n",
       " \"I stayed there to be close to the airport for an early flight on a Monday morning. The property opened in March '08, and it is by far the best Fairfield Inn I've stayed in. The rooms are magnificent, very well kept, and just an all-around beautiful hotel. The location is somewhat hard to get to when driving. The trick is to go to Dorval Avenue back and around over to Michel Jasmin avenue. It's well worth checking out an online map if you're headed to that hotel. [I was a Montreal local for 26 years and it still took my local friend &amp; I over 10 minutes to find the way to get there!]The hotel is of course close to the airport, and in a mostly industrial area, so forget about walking anywhere from that location.\",\n",
       " 'Stayed here because of airport proximity. Had not previously stayed in a Fairfield and was really impressed by the friendly, helpful staff, the convenient services, and the good value. Facilities were very nice -- I thought the small fitness room was well equipped for this level of hotel. Indoor pool looked well maintained. They provided some good restaurant recommendations and a map to the nearest gas station (not far), but roads are very confusing in that area since there are so many highways coming together. Room was clean, comfortable, and a good size. Cont. breakfast was good, including belgian waffles you can make yourself. My only complaint was the noise from the trains -- quite loud even at the highest floors. I would definitely stay here again.',\n",
       " \"Travelling by car, in town two nights to attend a family function.. The location of this brand new hotel was a nightmare. It is situated on the edge of two roundabouts (all signs in french) which facilitate entry to the airport. Please keep in mind that we grew up in this area and are very familiar with the &quot;Dorval Circle&quot; flow of traffic but there are no words to describe how difficult it is get get to this hotel. If I found it a challenge to get to, I cannot begin to imagine what a tourist would go through to get to this location. When we finally did arrive I asked the desk clerk to give me his rendition of directions and if I'd followed his directions I'd still be in the car!! I can't fault him however, because I don't even think I could give directions in this case, it simply defies words. Oh the noise.......This hotel is located directly beside a major train station and freight line. With freight trains passing 200 feet from your room all night don't expect to get any sleep. The hotel itself is brand new, the room was very nice, exceptionally clean and the staff are friendly. No faults there, everything you would expect from a Marriott hotel. (I'd give the hotel itself 4 stars). The rate is quite reasonable however the trade off of location an noise is just not worth the savings. I would have gladly paid an extra $60 per night to get some sleep. Sorry to say but we would recommend giving this GEM a miss.\",\n",
       " 'Just stayed there after long flight from Rome. Glad to be back at a Marriott style Hotel. Very kind front desk people. Brand new Hotel, as was less then 2 months old when we stayed. Increadibly clean and good breakfast. 32inch LCD Tv was a bonus. Big rooms and Marriott level bedding which we always appreciate. Watch out as cabs charge a minimum $12 from Airport to about 2km from Airport, a ripoff. Take the shuttle for free. Recommend it as a GREAT STAY.',\n",
       " \"The Fairfield at the Montreal airport is more like a 5 star property than your standard Fairfield. I usually stay at Marriott properties and normally find the Fairfield line a little less expensive but quite sufficient compared to the Courtyard or high rise selections, so I was prepared for the usual Fairfield level of hotel. This particular one was very new and so clean you could eat off the floor if desired. There wasn't a speck of dirt or dust anywhere in the entire hotel and the lobby is quite impressive. Highly recommended.\",\n",
       " \"I am a former travel editor at one of the most upscale American magazines. I have travelled the globe and am never unduly impressed... and can't bear pretension. But I was totally taken with the Hotel Gault. Small, exceptionally gracious staff, stunning and chic, superb location on quiet side street on the edge of Old Town. Two minute walk to metro. Totally stylish and original hotel... marvel at how they took an old warehouse, made it cutting edge modern in appointments and kept it at the same time warm and welcoming. Not hard edge like a Shrager hotel. Really magical. In the a.m. they bring you wake up coffee... when you're ready. Lovely to return to a hotel where they know your name.... and yet you are in a big city.\",\n",
       " 'The staff at this hotel should be cloned!! They made our stay there feel like we were family!! Only negative was the carpet in our room had stains on it. Otherwise, we were extremely comfortable, the bed was wonderful, loved the linens and drapes. Will definitely return.',\n",
       " \"My wife and I decided to book a trip to Montreal, and at the last minute brought my parents along as well. The four of us stayed at the Hotel Gault, which I found through Tripadvisor. We stayed on the 4th floor in an Etcetera room, while my parents were on the 5th floor top 5 room. Both rooms were minimalist in design but that only lended to the vast spaciousness of them. It was like having a big loft size apartment in the city. First and foremost, besides the exquisite rooms, the staff at this hotel were superb. Bruno, our bellman, drew up city itineraries for us and was accommodating every step of the way. Then there was Brian, who worked the front desk. Brian gave us restaurant recommendations that were spot on. Everywhere he told us to eat ended up being delicious. When we were leaving for back home, we were low on ice and Andre (another staffer) ran down the street to get us more. He then stood on the corner in front of the hotel with another employee, waving goodbye as we drove off. I've stayed at hotels all over the world, and never have I seen the level of excellence that this place exudes in every area. Beautiful rooms, impeccable staff and the value for your money can not be beat ANYWHERE in Montreal. One last note, the Gault is a 4 star hotel and on this same trip, because Gault was booked for our last night, we (not my parents) had to check into a famous 5 star downtown Montreal hotel. This place, although nice, couldn't hold a candle to our experience at Gault. In fact, when our bathroom TV was broken and our mini bar key didn't fit, the staffers told us &quot;we'll take care of it&quot;, not once apologizing. We were just another number...that is something we never felt at the Hotel Gault. The staff there waited on us hand and foot. All 4 of us give the Hotel Gault our highest recommendation and can't wait to go back.\",\n",
       " 'We booked one of the Extrassential rooms, which are the corner rooms above the entrance to the hotel at the intersection of rue Sainte-Hlne and rue des Recollets. Unfortunately, at the time of our visit, the building catty-corner from the entrance to Hotel Gault was undergoing renovation, which meant construction noise outside our window from about 7 am to 3pm on weekdays. This actually wasnt too loud at first, but on the third morning of our stay, the city started ripping up two streets near the hotel- rue Sainte-Hlne and rue Notre Dame- and THAT was pretty darn loud. And of course, the loudest part of it always seemed to occur at 7 in the morning. Not exactly what one wants to deal with on a vacation!Other than that, our room was very comfortable, spacious, and stylish; the best parts were the large shower, and having 3 tall windows that could be opened out onto the street. There was a lot of storage space in the room. DVDs and newspapers were available downstairs, and the staff was friendly and helpful. The free breakfast is served until 11 am (!) on weekdays, later on weekends, which is a first for any hotel Ive stayed at. One negative was that the in-room safe was very light and not bolted down, which made it seem easy for someone to pick up and remove (not that anyone would be desperate enough to want my obsolete iPod! but perhaps other travelers actually have something valuable to store). The hotel is on the edge of Vieux Montreal, and we were amused that when we took the walking tour of Montreal from Guidatour it stopped at one point in front of our hotel; we could also watch the horse-drawn carriages going by from our window. The hotel is about a 5 minute walk from metro Square-Victoria, but a longer walk to Place Jacques-Cartier (10-15 minutes). I should note that the windows are very thick, and the construction noise is probably a lot less noticeable in the rooms further down rue des Recollets, away from rue Sainte-Hlne. Thankfully construction is always temporary.',\n",
       " 'Stayed in the lull between xmas and new year. What a great hotel, great location, rooms good size, wonderful bathrooms. Stylish, staff lovely. Oh and great to have a little gym. Only slight criticism might be the lack of food available outside of breakfast hours, not huge choice.',\n",
       " 'Gault hotel is truly a nice place to stay: room is beautifully decor, huge in size and with details of style (i.e. the curtain used to separate bedroom from bathroom much original than a simple concrete wall) that make your stay enjoyable. To be honest, there are a couple of things that dont seem to fit (at least in my room): the red chair and the tea table were somewhere out of place. All the other pieces of furniture, from the carpets to the bed linen were just superb and matched nicely. Staff was helpful, breakfast delicious (not huge selection but everything fine, specially fruit salad), and hotel very conveniently located, just at the door of vieux Montreal main attractions On the downside, just a couple of small things the very street door doesnt make a welcome feeling: there is a flight of stairs from street level up to reception, if there is no a porter on hand (he wasnt when we arrived) you have to push your luggage all the way up no funny business. although the breakfast is included, if you want to order something different from filter coffee, you should pay extra',\n",
       " \"We had a wonderful weekend getaway in Montreal at the Hotel Gault. If you like modern design with a mid-century feel you'll love the design esthetic of this Hotel. We had come to Montreal specifically to check out the antique stores selling mid century, vintage furniture ( check out Amherst Street ) so we really enjoyed pouring over the many design books in the lobby. Our room was wonderful, the service was excellent , we got great restaurant recommendations. The hotel is within walking distance of dozens of restaurants and art galleries, all kinds of shopping and even a few museums. We felt the price was a great deal especially considering the delicious breakfast buffet. We are looking forward to coming back next year.\",\n",
       " \"Stayed at the Gault 2 nights this august during the Roger's Cup tennis tournament.If you like small hotels with great design,amenities &amp; superb service,this is the place for you,not to mention the exquisite breakfast which is included + free internet.The hotel has class &amp; the staff could not be any friendlier!An oasis of piece in the perfect location.\",\n",
       " \"This is the last time we will be staying at the Gault...time to move on. Carpets in rooms are dirty and need changing. Service is deteriorating. Bar service is minimal. No help with luggage. Hotel was never designed with comfort and travellers' need in mind. This was ok as long as the deco and service was outstanding, Now the hotel is just irritating. don't get me wrong, it's not a bad place....it just isn't what it used to be.\",\n",
       " \"I stayed two nights in one of the loft rooms on the top floor. I had high expectations resulting largely from the enthusiasm of trip advisor reports. As a functional hotel, it worked reasonably well. The style was modern, no fuss and reasonable quality. The reception/concierge people were helpful. The location is good - on the fringe of the old town. It wasentirely satisfactory but not in nay way exciting. The ground floor area is perfectly functional but somewhat soulless. The room was much larger than I needed (or wanted) and again rather cold: concrete floor with rugs. There were minor niggles such as the breakfast arae being too small for the number of guests and the relative inefficiency of the staff. Would I stay there again - yes if I couldn't do better. But I'm reasonably confident I will do better.\",\n",
       " 'Hotel Gault was the epitome of class, sophistication, modern design, and charm. My stay here was very comfortable and relaxing. The hotel staff were so friendly and helpful, and the rooms were minimalistic(loved!) and so beautifully set up. I loved the heated tiles in the bathroom. The rooms had such a modern romantic feeling to them! The breakfast was nothing short of delicious, as well as their signature cocktail. I had a fantastic stay here, and would recommend it to anyone going for business or pleasure.',\n",
       " \"This was our 3rd stay at the Hotel Gault in the past few years, this time to attend the Montreal Jazz Festival. Once again, we were very pleased with the experience at this true boutique hotel. Service is thorough and professional. The building is a renovated heritage warehouse and the rooms (only about 30 rooms in all) have very high ceilings, polished concrete floors (most, not all), huge Parisienne windows, lush beds and a cool layout (pocket doors, washrooms that open into the room with private WC). The location is perfect for us - on the very northwest corner of Old Montreal, close to the dining, shopping and culture but surrounded by heritage office buildings that assure a quiet night's sleep. We love the understated elegance and will defiitely return....again. Ask for a room with a balcony - they are very limited. They also have 1 great suite that we had on our previous visit that has an adjoining room that is perfect for 2 couples travelling together or a family with older children. Outstanding value.\",\n",
       " \"We hope the owner of the Hotel Gault appreciates his fantastic staff. They are truly the nicest people you will ever meet and competent to boot. Thank you Andre (I still hate myself for not listening to you, twice) and the rest of the lovely people at the beautiful Hotel Gault. We miss you and can't wait to come back. Steve and Lynn, Detroit\",\n",
       " \"I recently spent 3 nights at Hotel Gault, Montreal.I was extremely impressed with the hotel and felt that it was superior to all the other Tripadvisor hotels I stayed at during my Trip to Las Vegas, Montreal, Quebec and Mont Tremblant, including the Four Seasons/Westin/etc. All the other ones were great, but Hotel Gault has got something SPECIAL....a sense for incredible design and decor. In fact, besides the Four Seasons Maui, it might have been the best hotel I ever stayed at.PROs:- The interior design of Hotel Gault is world class. The chairs, the beds, the tables, the showers - it is all very practical, but also very beautiful. - The loft style rooms are simply gorgeous, with high ceilings and beds that make you want to spend all day in bed. Extremely comfortable.- No room is the same, so you'll get a bit of a different experience every time you're at the hotel- The front desk's employees and the concierges are extremely knowledgeable and very friendly- Internet and breakfast is FREE- The location is in a quiet street in Old Town Montreal. Simply perfect.CONs:- This is hard....the only thing I can think of is that it takes from 7.30am to 7.30pm to get clothes dry-cleaned, unless you want to pay $35 extra. And if you require a bath tub instead of a shower, make sure you make your reservation by phone, most rooms only have a shower.When staying in Montreal, this is THE place to be. You don't have to trust me, but you can trust Bill Clinton, he always stays there when he's in town.\",\n",
       " 'We do not usually use this kind of hotel but were seduced by the comments of others on TA. Though the overall experience was good there were little irritations that could be addressed : chipped paint in the bathroom, dodgy curtain fixings, no in-room coffee making facility, the only full length mirror being in the toilet(!), insufficient rails to hang towels. However, the location is first class and the staff very friendly and helpful. The rooms are huge if you stay on the top floor as we did.',\n",
       " \"In February, my wife and I had spent time at the Gault in one of their larger rooms. This time we chose their basic level room, queen bed no bathtub, as nothing else was available. Once again the service was superb and the room immaculate. We really enjoyed the room with its bare stone wall and huge window overlooking an inner 'courtyard' (really car park) as it was dead quiet and private. The design of the room was great though fans of watching TV would be disappointed as the TV was small and not a flat screen. We read from their extensive design and art library in the lobby so were totally satisfied. The breakfast buffet had a good variety of food and the coffee was superb.\",\n",
       " 'My wife and were in Montreal for a vacation and based on TA reviews took a room at the Gault. The place more than lived up to the big hype. Terrific location (about 2-3 blocks from the Metro, walking around in Vieux Montreal), extremely cordial, friendly and helpful service, and a fantastic breakfast. It was a bit difficult for our minibus driver to find, but the Gault is really just a very quiet block off busy McGill and not hard to find at all. We stayed there for four nights and loved our comfortable, minimalist room. Would definitely stay at the Gault again.',\n",
       " 'My husband and I spent our wedding weekend at the Gault, and I would not have changed a thing. I had spoken with the concierge well in advance and asked for flowers be placed in the room before our arrival. When they brought us up to our room, they were there, and they were exactly what I had asked for. The staff were friendly, courteous, and always attentive to our needs. The room was spectacular, airy and beautifully furnished. The only oddity that I noticed was the towel hooks -- although perfectly functional -- needed to be re-anchored.',\n",
       " 'We loved our stay at the Hotel Gault. We stayed in one of the corner rooms which was spacious. The bed was sooooo comfortable and the large windows let in a lot of natural light. The only downside is that the hotel is very minimal and there were no extras in the room like tea/coffee making. The breakfast buffet which was included in the rate was ok but no hot food and some of the choices were a bit odd for breakfast. I asked for scrambled eggs and bacon and when it came it was inedible and when challenged he only replaced the scrambled eggs and the bacon was then cold! I then found out that I had to pay 14 CAN $ for this breakfast! However, overall this is a fantastic hotel, the staff were very friendly and helpful. It is also in a marvellous location for sightseeing.',\n",
       " 'I will keep this short because everything I say about this hotel has been previously written. The rooms (and bathrooms) are enormous and comfortable. The place is the perfect size for a boutique hotel and in a great location. The food at the restaurant is amazing, tasty and so artistic. You really cannot find a better place to stay in Montreal for the price.',\n",
       " 'We stayed four nights at the Hotel Gault. Impeccable friendly service with real insider knowledge. Very comfortable boutique hotel rooms, spotlessly clean, perfect bathrooms, free high speed WiFi access in the reception/lobby area. High end and tasty buffet breakfast available.Hotel Gault is perfectly situated in the western part of old Montreal. Five minute walk to Square Victoria metro station. Ten minute walk to centre of old Montreal. Fifteen minute walk to Rue St Catherine shopping district.Would heartily recommend this hotel and very happy to stay there again.',\n",
       " \"Fulfilled every expectation of being unusual, luxurious and the ideal retreat. If you want something small with all the mod essentials and more personality and a sleeker style than typical white-space design hotels, then this is it. Great for independent travellers wanting a haven, but still right in the centre. Would definitely choose Gault again. In a quiet but convenient zone between the charming old town with its many different types of restaurants, and the mass shopping and business districts. The quiet street and area felt safe at night. Victoria Square Metro is 2 minutes walk away and the main train station is under 10 minutes. You don't hear a sound from the street.Enough touches of softness and colour to make it feel welcoming, and the spacious open plan reception, bar and breakfast area has cosy corners. In the rooms, high ceilings and pared down interiors give a bright airy feel. Unlikely to be any bad choice of room here. Stayed in two types, and both were much larger than the norm. The slightly smaller room could do with a work desk rather than slim table.Breakfast over the weekend especially has a wide choice. More continental style rather than cooked, it has plenty to keep you interested and looks like the chef has carefully chosen to add a touch of variety rather than the same every day. Attentive staff always seemed alert.\",\n",
       " \"As is our annual tradition, to cap off a week of skiing in the Eastern Townships, we spent a weekend in Montreal. While we have really enjoyed the St. Sulpice in Old Montreal in previous years, we felt it was time for a change and selected the Gault based on TA reviews, amongst other recommendations. We thoroughly enjoyed our stay. The lobby/front desk/bar/lounge/restaurant is essentially one large high ceiling room with funky decor and generally attentive service. They were a little short-staffed on check-in, but once they turned attention to us, we felt well cared for and our car was whisked quickly away.The rooms are incredibly hip and comfortable, but probably not to everyone's taste. Notwithstanding the stripped-down decor, a large modern art print or photo or two on the walls would be a nice touch. The open-style bathroom was just fine, although the lighting was a little counter-intuitive, and lacking a few little details (e.g. there was no where to hang your towel or robe within easy reach of the shower). If you are inclined to unpack your suitcase, you may find the hanging space a little limited and the drawers more fun that functional. But aside from these quibbles, it was a fine room. (I don't recall the name, but we had the king bed room.)Breakfast is quite lovely, with some unusual elements (not the standard continental) and, at least on weekends, available quite late into the morning. When I asked for a tray to take breakfast to my room, it took a minute to find one, but they happily obliged.The front desk was helpful with confirming our dinner reservations, providing taxis or directions, etc. When we arrived back one evening after a glutonous meal at Le Pied au Couchon, desperately in need of a degustif, we were able to sign for drinks at the bar and walk with them up to our room (unheard of in Ontario!).All in all, a pleasure and we would happily stay again.\",\n",
       " \"I just spent the weekend at Hotel Gault, celebrating my husband's birthday. Located on the quieter western edge of Old Montreal the hotel is a ten-minute walk to the waterfront, Place Jacques-Cartier and Hotel W (its rival). The elevator serves five floors, the 4th floor has 5 rooms, with gym in the basement. The restaurant is in the lobby and comprises about 12 tables at one side (more formal) and 6 round casual tables with multicoloured chairs close to the bar. All the furniture is contemporary; the lobby seat looks like an open baseball glove. The back of the lobby is arranged with artsy fartsy magazines, and side wall with DVDsall terrific. We watched Kurosawa (again), staying up until 3 am. I wanted a room with a stone or brick wall because I get nervous around modern Toronto-style architecturethus reserving the Terra room. There was a wedding so the Terra room had disappeared and we were upgraded to a room that gave me the wobbliesit had no age to it, no olden walland I had even declined this room during the reservation process because of this fact. I refused this room and asked for a downgrade please, much to the shock of the staff. No joy. Instead we ended up in a suite that was truly magnificent with corner window and Juliette balcony, clad in wooden shutters. A sitting area with large screen TV faced a rectangular sofa (no cushions and very uncomfortable in the long term for watching movies), this zone spanned by a stunning multicoloured carpet. There were 6 speakers, one of which worked. Apparently, they all work only with the DVD and it took someone 15-20 minutes to turn it on for us. After he removed his test DVD we could not get ours to work. Theres something about spending time with hi-tech when you travelits annoying learning new systems. Then there is a dining table and small kitchenette separating the eating from sleeping areas. The miele hot plate accommodates 2 pans, 1 is supplied. The cooking accoutrements ranked a 1:10, but we were not there to cook so no problem. There was a sort of coffee machine that looked like a combination ice-cream maker meets playdoh squishing machine. No coffee was supplied thats deliberate madame, nor mugs, nor sugar. Missing also was the flash light supplied in your safe. Sometimes I fret about what is not in the room that is supposed to be in the room. Will it appear on my credit card in the future? Instead room service was needed for coffee and you were on your own in an electrical outage. The best coffee on the planet was then served in a piping hot thermos enough for 2 1/2 cups (read: an immediate call for a 2nd thermos was essential if my husband wanted to quench his thirst). The bed is king size and has what appears to be a down quilt and pillows. The bedding was terrific, the bed was not as comfortable. The bathroom had a beautiful large oval tub for two, with large shower and Grohe spray. We have those at home and no we would not get them again (think WaterPic). Too bad no hot tub. Square sink on rectangular surface. Molton Brown bottles. The concrete floor was not cold, but my hooves turned slightly black. Nooks and crannies hid clothing, ironing board etc. It was a great spaceuber trendy and bordering on a high-tech lawyers office (not my kind of home from home). The receptionist Brian said that this was one of their best rooms. But watch out guys, the rooms are beginning to look shabby. The glass table in the living room had chips along the edges, the second table attached to it was at a slight misaligned angle (watch those wine glasses!), the door over the safe was warped and detaching, broken vases were hidden in kitchen drawers, and that cute magazine holder in the pathway of everyone moving into the lounge area has been dinged so many times the vertical edges look like they have teeth. The room we moved up from was also shabbytears in the bed platform textile, black rubberized streaks on the light grey concrete floor. And that room was an office that happened to have a bed in it can I plug your computer in for you madame? I feel guilty for pointing these detractions out, having been upgraded, but maybe someone will pay attention to detail and make your stay even more special than was ours. With respect to servicethe best received to date on this planet, from valet parking to check-out. Kudos to Remi. The brunch on Sunday was stunning. Not the Montreal bagel here, folks. But delicate (if beans can be called delicate) salads of Gourmet Bistro quality and great variety. Boconcini on tomato. And dessertsapricot crumbleto die for. Dont miss brunch folks! More coffee. Yes, more. Grapefruit and orange juice. Make yourself seated in the lobby. We took the Blissful Deluxe packagewe each had 45 mins of massage in our room by a zen artist, a DVD later, a cocktail not of our choicevodka, lychee and cranberry, and a glass of wine instead of champagne. Strawberries dipped in chocolate. The system was a little strangewe didnt know where were the coupons we ran out, or whether we had the chocolates with the cocktail no, with the champagne, or if we used the TV to order the DVD no, they are in the lobby for pick up. We asked for an extension of stay past the noon check out and were happily granted it (we stayed less than half an hour longer). Our car was brought around. The total bill was around 450$ for one night, plus we left $50 in tips (valet parking, the masseuse, room service). I never know what to do here, but that seemed fair at the time. So, the rooms were 7-8:10, service 10:10, parking 10:10, brunch 10:10, coffee 11:10. Perhaps Im a little hard to serve at times, I notice small things like someone else taking a table cleared and set for us (I am currently walking-challenged courtesy of an ice-wipe out near Schwartz smoked meat, and the other tables were the farthest possible from the buffet), so dealing with me 11:10. I also noticed that this was a friendly hotel for gays, so 10:10 for that too. My tip is to come on a special weekendwhen the fireworks are on, a festival is in townlike the jazz fest, or Fete des lumieres when most all the galleries are open 24 hours. A hotel that is great for the 20s-40s crowd, single, in pairs, or threesomes. Montreal has much to offer, and Old Montreal even has brick walls in your bedroom. (And thanks Again Brian for the room upgrade)\",\n",
       " \"Gault hotel is at the heart of Montreal and its location could not be better. The rooms are huge and some details in the design are just amazing and the food was more than decent.Yet , I have to admit one of my most vivid memories of the hotel are the stained, one with one of those big brown stains and the oter one had pubic hair which obviously weren't mine. I can't believe there is so much attention given to details, yet I obviously got stained towels that should have been clean, since it was nicely folded on the side of the shower.I just was not able to figure out how someone could have miss that, and to be honest, I was disgusted enough just not to ask for replacement towels, preferring to find more hygienic ways to get dry. I've traveled a lot and I'm not a very hard client to satisfy. My only need is just a minimal this is just the kind of things I can't get over. This is just the kind of things I can't get over and although my overall stay has been pleasant, I would never recommend this hotel.\",\n",
       " 'Just returned from a long weekend at Hotel Gault. While the weather in Montreal was chilly, the Gault was warm, friendly and inviting. With help from Andre and the staff, we were able to find our way around Montreal with ease. Lots of great restaurants within walking distance and the Centre Bell, where we attended the Celine Dion concert, was a mere 15 minute walk away. The rooms are simple but equipped with what a traveler would need while away from home. The beds are comfy and warm and the bathroom clean. We enjoyed the brunch, the cocktail at happy hour and the chocolates on the bed at nighttime. We will definitely be back -- hopefully, when the weather is a bit warmer!',\n",
       " \"From the moment we arrived the hotel failed to live up to expectations. The bellhop had no trolley so meant that he carried one case while we carried the other. At check-in we were told we were upgraded but actually ended up in the same room we had booked, an essential Top 5 room. The room itself had the feel of a sauna rather than the modernist feel the website suggests. The whole room felt tired from the chipped wood on the workstation thru the stained showerstall floor to the very office style greyish carpet. We didn't get to try the balcony as the recent snowfall had not been cleared.We then read thru the welcome letter which suggested there was a list of recommended restaurants in the handbook but we couldn't find them for love nor money. We then asked at the frontdesk and after about 5 minutes we finally got a printout of suggestions. However we were warned that they'd all be likely fully booked already and were offered no alternatives! Only half of the restaurants on the list had a website address and none of them had a phone number listed. We then went back upstairs to use our PC to check the websites however we needed an adapter to charge it as we'd forgotten ours. After much seaching at the front desk no adapter could be found.  After that we decided to chance our luck finding a restaurant with a wander around outside but first we thought we'd stop by and grab a drink at the bar. The barman was mixing some cocktails for a large group which was fine as he explained that but during that time we sat there without even a menu while the girl in recption stood there doing nothing. After 15mins we got a drink, bear in mind we were one of only 2 groups in the whole bar.Having said all that the breakfast the next morning was great and the staff member on duty was fantastic.Next time I'll stay at the Nelligan\",\n",
       " 'Good:I have stayed at Hotel Gault half a dozen times over the past three years. It is consistently excellent: fair prices (especially if booked in advance), fantastic non-smoking public spaces (great breakfast buffet) and cool, comfortable rooms. There is free WiFi throughout the hotel, and the location on the slightly gritty edge of the old city (Vieux Port) is fantastic.Bad:Front desk service is always good -- but sometimes it is only just good. (For instance, I am never recognized as a repeat visitor, and the staff can sometimes be a bit cold -- but not always; sometimes they are fine). The rooms are air-heated, which can lead to dryness. Not all rooms have tubs -- though the showers are terrific. Most rooms have single wash basins for those who have grown accustomed',\n",
       " \"Since we live in Montreal, did not stay at the hotel but went there for the brunch on Sunday morning. The service was fast, friendly and professional. Delightful ambiance (loved the artwork, furnishings and Christmas derations) and excellent not-your-standard brunch foods (combination of ordering from menu and buffet). highly recommend for visitors and Montrealer's alike!\",\n",
       " \"We really loved our stay at the hotel. When we walked in, Andre was there to greet us with a warm smile. He knows his stuff and use his suggestions and expertise. The front staff was very warm and helpful, especially for small requests, spa suggestions, etc.The location was great although too bad it was cold (we're from the West Coast so we are not good with cold LOL!). The hotel lobby was amazing - I loved the art pieces. The room was clean, simple and modern. The heated tile floor was great in the bathroom. The bed was super comfy and overall a great view of Old Montreal from our Extraessential room.The one thing we both raved about was the breakfast that was included with our room price. It was DELICIOUS! I will never look at continental breakfast the same ever again! Great coffee, great selection, and loved the choice of a la carte.For the price we paid (we had a government rate, which is around the same as the promo rate), there was nothing substantial to complain about. We would come back again for sure and I loved Montreal so much.Our only suggestions were(although I was told that there were significant changes happenning in terms of renovations, new artwork, paint, tvs etc. in the next year - can't' wait!)a) flat screen lcd tv screensb) perhaps an ipod docking station?c) the shower needed a bit of a scrub and some washroom fixtures looked a little wornd) the floors were a little worn but nothing bige) the gym maybe a bit bigger? more equipment? not that people come to montreal to work out!f) the toiletries, i would have recommended something other than the spruce scent - i know scent is very particular and the brand they offered was excellent, i just thought it was very masculineOther than the above, thanks to all the amazing staff and what a wonderful beautiful hotel.\",\n",
       " 'My husband and I stayed at the Hotel Gault for a week long vacation. It was one of our favorite hotels. It is well located in Old Montreal. We were able to walk or take the Metro to all Montreal neighborhoods. The other reviews on TA were accurate and helped finalize our choice.The hotel is modern and minimalistic. It is a wonderful blend of an upscale boutique hotel, yet not over the top and intimidating. There may not be as many bells and whistles as other traditional luxury hotels, but I thought the key choices were well made. The staff is extraordinarily gracious and multi-talented. Michel and Brian were especially helpful in their restaurant recommendations and we enjoyed our many conversations with them. We reserved the extrassential room which was a spacious corner room with large windows that opened. While the concrete floor did show some wear, it did not detract from our stay and the room was very clean.When we return to Montreal, we would definitely return to Hotel Gault.',\n",
       " 'My husband and I went to Montreal for the first time this past summer and were looking for a modern, nice hotel close to Old Montreal. Travel and Leisure recommended this hotel, we found a good deal on the hotel website and we booked it! We had a fantastic time in Montreal and the staff at Hotel Gault, especially their concierge (Andre I think was his name) made our stay memorable. Andre got us a reservation at a near by restaurant called Le Locale, it serves innovative french food. The hotel was comfortable, clean, modern and with diferent spaces to relax, from the gym to the lobby to the library.We loved this hotel and would go back. I have read other reviews here, my advise to you dear reader is: believe all the raving. This hotel is great!',\n",
       " 'Just returned from a 3 night stay at the Hotel Gault. We obtained our research from this website and our efforts paid off. All the positive reviews of this hotel are on the mark. The hotel is in a convenient location in old Montreal, the rooms are large comfortable and clean and the staff were enormously gracious and helpful. The breakfast was exceptional as well. We have travelled throughout the world and have stayed at many wonderful hotels and this hotel is at the top of our list for price, comfort and service. We will definitely recommend to any of our friends who plan on visiting Montreal.Steve &amp; HeatherSt. Catharines, Ontario, Canada',\n",
       " \"there were few things that fell short. The hotel is very attractive and the staff were mostly friendly but sometimes they would be so overwhelmed with one client checking in or out that the entire staff seemed to be dealing with them and not realizing another guest waiting to speak to them should have been acknowledged. Also, the hotel front is on a corner of two side streets, there is no real &quot;pull up&quot; if you arrive by car...also since there is no doorman on the street, and you have to open the street doors, go up a flight of stairs, go through another door and then cross the room to find someone who works there, that was unfortunate on our arrival as we didn't know how to negotiate our luggage, parking, etc. Secondly, I asked for the Terra Room as I was interested in the free standing tub. The tub was wonderful, but the room itself had concrete floors with only a small rug on either side of the bed, and the floors were very very marked up and appeared dirty and the rugs were stained, so that was a little disappointing when checking in, but we got over it. All in all I thought the hotel staff was helpful and friendly when approached, the breakfast was good, the price reasonable, the linens fresh, and the location very convenient to Old Montreal, but we also walked easily to the shopping and museum area.\",\n",
       " 'All the positive TA reviews of Hotel Gault are 100% true! Our recent two-night stay at Hotel Gault was absolutely perfect: minimalist chic but with warmth and outstanding creature comfort! We loved the blend of the old and ornate architectural exterior with the more stark and loft design of the interior. The public spaces had both a rarefied and inviting openness about it with clever combinations of warm blond wood and tin ceiling and concrete walls, with wonderful displays of modernist art and whimsical but perfectly comfortable furniture. Our Extraessentiel room with its high ceiling was huge, and the bathroom with its separate tile &amp; glass shower and its separate tub was also spacious --approaching the size of an entire hotel room in some cities! The bed and bed and bath linen were all plush and of excellent quality. The decor was minimalist and stylish, with use of warm colors. Service was exceedingly nice and attentive. The bountiful breakfast service with an abundant variety started at 6:30, with coffee and espresso made to order. The location in Old Montreal was charming with small restaurants and coffee shops nearby while being a little away from the heavier tourist traffic; it took us about 20 minutes on foot to get to Centre Ville for our work-related meeting, which made for a nice and enjoyable way for us to see the street and sidewalk culture of both sides of Montreal. I am afraid that now that Hotel Gault has just re-affirmed for us the meaning of &quot;boutique&quot;, we will be obsessed with finding something similar to it whenever we travel!',\n",
       " \"Wow! We travel often for both business and leisure, and when a special birthday trip brought us to Montreal, we chose the Hotel Gault. What an excellent decision we made.Simply put, this is one of the two or three finest hotels I've ever been to, anywhere in the world. And for it's price range, it's certainly #1. The closest comparison in terms of quality, location and service I can think of is the wonderful MyHotel Chelsea in London.As other reviewers have stated, the property itself is gorgeous. We were in a &quot;Terra&quot; room and it certainly lived up to the amazing reviews. Another fantastic feature was the included breakfast, and we even had dinner at the property once.The staff were universally wonderful. Polite, friendly, helpful, and patient with my embarrassingly bad French (I'm working on it).While the location is great and central, especially for those looking to do some sight-seeing and &quot;touristy&quot; things, we spent the bulk of our time several Metro stops away, easily accessible from the nearby station.Thank you, Hotel Gault, for being the cornerstone of a wonderful vacatino.\",\n",
       " \"The tripadvisor reviewers were right on. We had a fantastic stay at the Hotel Gault, located in charming Old Montreal and within walking distance to the downtown area, Victoria Square Metro Station and Chinatown. We were in the Terra Room, which was more spacious, well-designed and furnished than I anticipated; the hotel photos didn't do it justice at all. The service was exceptional with nightly turn-down service, weather reports for the next day and bottled water. Although room could be a bit high, we were able to save a bit by prepaying in advance.\",\n",
       " 'Excellent hotel. Staff extremely helpful. Accommodations wonderful. Decorated in modern style in great taste. Breakfast included was delicious. Within walking distance of Old Montreal. Thoroughly enjoyed the hotel.',\n",
       " \"My girlfriend and I spent 3 great nights at Hotel Gault and were beyond pleased with the level of service and hospitality of the staff. Since the hotel is quite popular and was booked full, we had to stay in an Extrassential room for two nights and a Extential room on our final night. And let me just say: both room types were amazing. The extrassential is a spacious corner suite with three large windows offering somewhat of a panoramic view to the outside. We had one slight problem, however, on our first night here: we noticed there was hair belonging to perhaps a previous guest on our bedsheets. Yuck! My girlfriend hated this, I didn't mind as much. But when we called the front desk, they quickly addressed the problem and had two housekeepers assigned to change our bed sheets right away. After this issue, the rest of our stay was smooth sailing! The Extential room was also very nice, a bit smaller. Yet, it actually felt a lot more warm and homey to us compared to the first room we had. Both rooms were great, but the smaller room just felt more comfortable. The drawback to this room type, though, is that you'll have no privacy when getting ready in the bathroom.The thing I will miss the most - by far - will be the courtesy continental breakfast they serve every morning. I love to eat and I eat well. I can say that the breakfast spread they offer is too good to be true. It was the best breakfast experience I have ever had! Everything is served fresh and is prepared with a sense of artistic detail. I just loved waking up each morning, knowing that the greatest breakfast in the Americas was waiting for me down in the hotel lobby!Overall, this hotel is top notch in Montreal and one that I would absolutely recommend to young people, couples and even families. It is a very chic establishment in a cool, quiet neighborhood. I will definitely stay here again if I ever visit Montreal again.\",\n",
       " 'My husband and I stayed at the Gault this past week and we were very impressed at the level of service we recieved. The concierge, Andre, made exceptional restaurant recommendations as well as helped us plan the next leg of our trip. He even made reservations at other hotels in the other destinations that we chose, based on his recommendations, and provided us with the confirmations as well as directions and maps to get there. We were shocked when he checked on us at our next destination to make sure we liked the hotel he recommeded as well as to tell us we left some items behind. He then packed up our items and sent them to our home. We are seasoned travelers and have never experienced this level of hospitality anywhere.The hotel is lovely. It is decorated as urban contemporary with an artistic flair. Our room was large and the bathroom was huge and very nicly decorated. it was also impeccably clean. It is within walking distance to restaurants, bars and cultural activities. We would confidently recommend this hotel to anyone.',\n",
       " 'Superb room, breakfast (included), lobby lounge. Room was very quiet, well provisioned. Great dinner in restaurant at reasonable price. Wonderful service was icing on the cake!!! Not for budget travellers but good value for everyone else at $220 given breakfast and two drinks were included in the price. Breakfast usually $20 p.p. and includes a buffet as well as hot food from a menu. Highly recommended.',\n",
       " 'I cannot recommend this hotel enough. The building is stunning. Request a room on the 5th floor; they have very nice outdoor patio areas. Beautiful contemporary rooms with very comfortable beds &amp; linens! Excellent value.',\n",
       " \"This is my 2nd stay with this hotel. I actually flew up several years ago when the hotel first opened and I had a great trip then. I flew to Montreal for business and I knew that I wanted to stay at the Gault again. This stay was as good as the first trip. The first trip I booked a &quot;Terra&quot; room but this time I booked a &quot;Top 5&quot; room. I booked directly with the hotel from their website and they are very quick to confirm and all communications were great. The &quot;Top 5 &quot; room that I booked was spacious and it was on one of the top floors. It also had a nice outdoor patio/terrace that I could walk out onto for fresh air. The bed was very comfortable and it had a small TV with a DVD player. There was no wi-fi in the room but wi-fi worked from the lobby. The room had free high speed internet with a cable but it was a bit uncomfortable as the desk was a high bar area and the chair wasn't the most comfortable. The bathroom had a nice shower. The area is great in Old Montreal and the buildings are gorgeous in this area. In fact I found it interesting that outside the hotel it said the building housed the first meeting of the YMCA over 100 years ago. The area is great with several bars and cafes in the area.The hotel staff is very friendly and there is a bar area as well that gets lively at night. The room included free breakfast downstairs but both days I was busy so I never got to enjoy it. I spent 2 nights here and it was very comfortable. I highly recommend this hotel to anyone going to Montreal. It was as good as the first year I went.\",\n",
       " \"Style and quality. spacious. idiosyncrasies of a boutique hotel (delayed check-in) but a top flight hotel in a great part of the city. staff, bar, room appointments all superb. one of montreal's finest in terms of value and personality.\",\n",
       " \"My husband and I visit the Hotel Gault every year. We have returned 4 years in a row. It is one of the most amazing properties I've ever visited. As time has passed, the hotel staff has not lost the attentiveness and attention to detail that makes it so special. The rooms are immaculately maintained, and the furnishings show little or no wear. The staff go out of their way to make a stay comfortable and memorable. The Gault is close to so much, yet it feels like a peaceful haven. Plus, they serve the most divine breakfast I think I have ever consumed outside of my own home. I cannot wait to return there again this year!\",\n",
       " \"My husband and I stayed in the &quot;Etcetera&quot; room at Hotel Gault last weekend and we absolutely loved it! It wasn't like staying at a hotel at all; it was like staying in your very own stylish modern loft-style condo. The huge bath was an impressive touch. There was lots of closet space and just lots of space overall; the room was huge. The staff were also very friendly. We went down to the lobby bar for a few drinks at happy hour and the martinis were very good. I had &quot;The Gault&quot; martini and my husband had a very subtle margarita. Breakfast the next morning was complimentary and very good; high quality, fresh and de'lish! Hotel Gault far exceeded our expectations and we will definitely go back soon.\",\n",
       " 'This was our first stay at the Hotel Gault, and we were very pleased.The staff were friendly and helpful at all times. Check-in was a breeze. The room was well-appointed. We had one of the corner &quot;Extraessentiel&quot; rooms, and it was very spacious. The shower was fantastic -- so often, hotel showers are such a disappointment, but this one was luxurious in comparison, given the size and water-pressure.The hotel is located in a beautiful old stone building, yet the decor inside is very contemporary. Our room was definitely &quot;minimalist&quot; in style, yet very comfortable nonetheless.The breakfast that came with the room was very nice. We had dinner one night in the lobby restaurant -- the menu was very appealing, and the food was great. We were very happy with our meal.The hotel is nicely located. Close to all of the sights in Old Montreal, yet easy walking distance to the shopping on Ste. Catherine. Fun thoroughfares such as St. Denis and St. Laurent are only three or four subway stops away.Our only criticisms of the Hotel Gault are minor. These are minor quibbles and did not detract from the overall wonderful experience.First, the room came with two bath towels -- extra towels would have been nice. We showered a couple of times each day, and it would have been nice the second time not to have to use the same damp towel from the morning. I suppose we could have asked for extra towels, but they should be provided as a matter of course (as in most hotels of this caliber).Second, the room contained some fantastic-looking modernist chairs, which were in keeping with the chic contemporary decor of the Hotel Gault. However, they were not the most comfortable of chairs. After a day of exploring Montreal, it would have been nice to sit back in a comfy chair and relax. I would not want over-stuffed cliched hotel chairs, but one does not have to sacrifice comfort for modernist and contemporary design. Next time they are upgrading the hotel furnishings, the Gault management should consider chairs that are both chic and comfortable -- such things do exist.Finally, and this is a problem with most hotels (not just the Gault) -- it is the 21st century, and the lack of a green program is inexplicable. The rooms did not even have blue bins for recycling. Unbelievable. Hotels like the Gault really need to start taking steps (above and beyond self-serving notes asking guests to re-use towels) to reduce their ecological footprint.',\n",
       " 'I stayed at Hotel Gault in November and I have nothing but good things to say. Firstly, we arrived rather late and check in was quick and welcoming. We were introduced to the friendly and courteous hotel staff and were told a few things about the hotel. I asked for recommendations for the following evening for dinner, as BYOW is something that lacks in Toronto. In the morning I was given 5 different options detailing locations, their personal reviews, crowd, and varying cuisines yet all pertaining to my requests! Excellent.My room was quiet, relaxing, and more than inviting. I had a great night sleep and was up and ready to go after my free in room breakfast. A full a l carte menu is included with free room service which was more than an added bonus as Montral can leave you paralyzed the morning after.The only thing I can say is that an LCD monitor would have been a nice added bonus, but nonetheless, the only issue I had.No matter the request, Hotel Gault went out there way for me - my friends and I agreed that we are pleased to have somewhere to stay when in Montreal.',\n",
       " \"One of the nicest hotels I've ever stayed in, and I've stayed in a lot. (I fly 120,000 miles a year). Beautifully designed. Super friendly staff. Great food. A &quot;hip&quot; hotel that makes you feel very welcome. Concierge, desk staff, etc. couldn't be nicer or more helpful. Older people may not think of it as &quot;luxurious&quot; - no overstuffed chairs, foo-foo decorations, etc. But if you like modern design, you can't beat it\",\n",
       " \"You may not like contemporary design (I do, and it's one more reason I love this hotel). But, even if you don't, the level of service here is simply amazing and should make even the most modern-design skeptic a lover of this hotel. My wife and I stayed in a suite with a private balcony: a suite that easily eclipsed the size of our manhattan apartment! All amenities you could ask for: a well conceived design from top to bottom: heated bathroom floors, huge windows, generous storage to hang suits, unpack, and really high quality linens. Notwithstanding how much I like the decor of the hotel, the staff and the professional level of service they provide are the main attraction in my opinion. Simply put: they are helpful and dedicated to making your stay comfortable and pleasant. We arrived very late but the hotel staff were there to park the car and bring our luggage to our room. I'm originally from Montreal and have seen a lot of the city's hotels when I've come back to visit. This hotel really exceeded my experiences with other hotels. My wife and I are sure to return.\",\n",
       " \"We only stayed at the Hotel Gault for one night, but it is deserving of a review. We arrived very late, around 2 am, but were still greeted with a warm and welcoming reception. After a quick and pleasant check-in we were shown to our room. The room is large and sleek with more space for storing clothes, luggage, etc. than I've seen in any other hotel. The bathroom was also very large and all of the furniture and decor, from the chairs to the drapes, were modern and beautiful. We loved the long, wooden desk and the concrete floors. We also loved the concrete walls in the hallway (see attached photo) and the view from our corner window was very nice. We ordered room service at 3 am and the food was excellent. An assortment of french cheeses with wine really hit the spot after our long day of driving. And again, the service was spectacular. Check out was expedient and friendly, and we left Hotel Gault wishing that we had more time to spend there. For those wishing to explore Old Montreal, the hotel's proximity to Basilique Notre-Dame de Montral and other attractions is perfect.\",\n",
       " 'I spent several nights at the Hotel Galt in Old Montreal because it I had just finished attending a conference at McGill University and I wanted to stay in another part of Montreal. I had previously stayed at the Doubletree Plaza and Sheraton Le Centre. This property is located on the Western outskirts of Old Montreal but the property is close enough to work to most of Old Montreal. I even walked from the business district to this property.During my stay in Montreal the weather was exceptional warm and dry. Check in was smooth, I was escorted to my top floor room by the Galt Rep. who checked me in. She showed me all of the details of the room. I asked for the most quiet and sun filled room in the property when I made my online reservation. I received a discount rate by purchasing my rooms in advance. When I entered room the radio/dvd player was playing classical music. The room was large with hip and super cool environment. The bed was comfortable.Television had many channels and rotated around to living room and kitchnette section of the room. The bathroom could be sectioned off from the kitchenette and bed area or could be opened up to both areas. The bathroom featured separate room for the toliet. Separate area for the bath tub and sink. Separate shower.The bathroom featured Molton Brown products which were all fine. Also bottled Galt water was provided on daily basis.My rate included continental breakfast and one hot dish (i.e. eggs or crepes) was very good. There is small gym in the basement. In old Montreal I recommend Sport Du Vieux (casual dining), Restaurant Du Vieux Port (steakhouse with exceptional and friendly service), and Restaurant Des Gouverrid (Freinch cuisine).I took the Greyline tour of Montreal and the tour company picked me up from the Hotel Galt. The day was sunny, dry and pleasant.The only issue I had with the property was the closet light did not operate and I did not mention this to the Galt Reps and it was not fixed during my staff. A couple of the Galt Reps were not friendly but most were fine.I was satisfied with my stay at Galt Hotel because the Hotel &amp; room were Hip &amp; Super Cool. My room was comfortable &amp; quiet. Service is very good. If you are planning to spend some time in your room, you can not go wrong with the Hotel Galt. I highly recommend this superb property in Old Montreal.',\n",
       " 'Very private and comfortable...the windows opened so we could keep stuff cold outside, it was March.

The room tastefully decorated in a contemporary setting and the furnishings very nice...lots of room to spread out into with plenty of space for personal stuff.',\n",
       " 'Warm regards to the staff and management of the Hotel Gault- they were amazing and deserve much praise. From the bellman to the breakfast staff, every person there was friendly, kind, concerned, and helpful. When we were given a map, the girl at the desk came right around and stood next to us, indicating points of interest... no disinterested leaning over a map across a desk, she cared. Umbrellas were readily available when the weather turned wet, and they were of nice quality too. Of course! The car was costly to park, but I expect that in a busy city, and they were most prompt in bringing it right up when asked. Good staff again...We were able to reserve a lovely huge room with a tub, happy us. The room was vast and well appointed- some may not care for the ultra modern concrete floors and minimalist style but I loved it. Internet connection was fast and easy, and the nightime chocolate was a nice touch.The breakfast! Lovely, and beautifully served as well. Probably my best eggs Benedict ever, now I am ruined for life... until I go back. First there is a nice buffet of cold items- meats cheeses breads fruits etc.; then they take your hot order and make you very full and very happy.So the Gault get best marks for service food rooms staff and location. As long as you like it cool and modern, you will be very happy here. I prefer it to the Vogue, which was also wonderful, but less stylish and the staff at Gault was simply superb. Thank you Gault for a very nice stay!',\n",

Lugging your bags up the stairs to the reception desk is not a pleasant way to start your stay. However, the concierge Pierre was great! My brother needed to find an an eye glass store and he pointed in the right direction and also each time you arrive at the Gault they always personally escort you to your room and explain how everything works, very nice touch as always.Our rate included a 3 course table d'hote dinner at the Gault Restaurant. The food was outstanding, the service was a joke! Management needs to teach our young lass Cindy some really service basics. We waited 15mins to even get a menu, another 10mins before she came and we had to ask for water, ask for bread, I mean really, come on, the basics here! I had to really just laugh at how truly awful she was. When three more couples came down for a drink at the bar, me and brother were being entertained as she was run off of her feet service a total of 8 guests including us. Again, the breakfast was outstanding for both morning and again service was slow and without passion, nor any real urgency.So to sum it be, I love the Gault, I just wish they would train their staff to have more pride and more passion and an eye for service details. I'll be back again just to see if they actually read these reviews and take the advice to heart of a frequent guest.But please do yourself a favour and stay here when visiting Montreal, the property is excellent and you will enjoy your stay, just beware the slow service!Btw, we also had afternoon tea at the St. James Hotel - do yourself a BIG favour and skip this totally overpriced experience not worth it all. Rather, just have a drink at their bar. The property is lovely.\",\n",

       " \"This used to be one of our favorite hotels. Our visit this summer, however, left us less than enthused. While the loft suite we reserved was aesthetically interesting, it was hard to enjoy our stay after finding hairs in the bathtub and a trashcan full of the previous occupant's party refuse in the kitchen (including a thrown away pair of jeans - yuck!). Service at the hotel is also not what it used to be. When we asked for recommendations for dinner after arriving late from Quebec city, the front desk person responded &quot;there are lots of places around&quot; with no further clarification. Other attempts to receive service (e.g., trying to find the bedside clock missing from our suite), were equally dismissed with no attempt to provide service or resolve problems. What a contrast with previous experiences when we found the hotel staff to be very attentive and warm. We don't know what happened to this hotel in the last year but with so many great choices in Montreal ( we had a great experience at Hotel Le Germain during the same trip), we doubt we would risk it and return here.\",\n",
       " \"We stayed for 5 nights and found Hotel Gault to be a sublime retreat. This exceptional hotel is centrally located for walking and near many great shops and restaurants. The rooms are serene retreats, oversized with loft like open design, and excellent ammenities. There's a library, living room, bar, and restaurant in the lobby. Staff members made us feel welcome and were always available to assist. After finishing a meal in the restaurant one evening, the chef sent cookies to our table that he had baked at home that morning!\",\n",
       " \"I am sitting in Room 520 as I write this review. We have a semi-private balcony. The room is very contemperary!

       " 'My wife and I stayed at the Hotel Gault July 20-21, 2007. We traveled to Montreal with 2 other couples for a fun weekend away from the kids. Montreal is fantastic and I would go again (I definitely recommend you take a bike tour of the city). However, I would not stay at the Gault again. On our 2nd night, there was a bachelor party in the suite next door to ours. Yes, a bachelor party in a hotel where I was paying $300/night to sleep! About two dozen twenty-somethings, stripper(s) (maybe prostitutes), alcohol, and lots of noise. They partied all night and into the morning. My wife and I called down to the reception desk many times, but it was not until 4am when I put on clothes and went down there myself that something was finally done. I thought the party should have been broken up and the guests kicked out, but the poor guy working alone in the middle of night did not do that. He merely moved the party, but the constant noise of their coming and going meant no sleep.The next day I kindly told the manager that I was not paying for that night. He actually tried to bargain with me, offering 20% off. I explained that the main reason I was staying at the hotel was to sleep, and since that did not happen, I was not paying. The manager did ultimately agree to comp that night, but I really did not give him any other choice.Other than that experience I liked the hotel. Great breakfast. Terrible gym. Good location. However, for the price, I expect to be staying somewhere that would have dealt with the bachelor party in a fast, definitive manner.',\n",
       " 'The Gault was everything it said it would be and more. The Concierge Andre was an excellent host and made our stay extra special. He advised us on the best that Montreal had to offer and was enthusiastic to ensure our stay was perfect.The hotel staff were smart and chic. Their efficiency ensured that our needs were always met. Our room/private terrace was very comfortable and we had several nights of peaceful sleep! Coming from Europe, the serenity of the Gault contributed to getting over jet lag alot more quickly. Having stayed in numerous hotels around the world from Palma de Mallorca to Sydney , I would highly recommend the Gault as a true boutique hotel!Devon, UK.',\n",
       " \"I stayed for two nights in mid-July '07 and had a great experience. The staff was fantastic. The room was uber-comfortable and really unique. It was quite modern, so if that's not your thing and you prefer an old wrought iron bed and antiques in the room, then look elsewhere. I was thrilled with my room... it was large, the high ceilings and long curtains behind the bed were dramatic, it had free internet access, and the bathroom was great. It was a tad further away from the center of old Montreal than some of the other boutique hotels, but no big deal.\",\n",
       " \"We usually stayed at the Fairmont QE in Montreal, but on account of the great reviews that this hotel has received, we decided to give it a try. And we got a good deal with their tasty promo.Had the extraessential (?) room that is a corner room with lots of space.Everyone we dealt with was super friendly and courteous.Received turndown both nights. No problem there.Room was made up by housekeeping while we were out. Did a good job cleaning.Had dinner at the hotel restaurant (came with room). Wonderful food and good service.Breakfast both days. Good selection, and included eggs or crepes made to order.Location is good. Two blocks at most from subway entrance, which connects to underground world in Montreal. Very convenient (especially when it rained the way it did when we were there).On a quiet street, but right next to busy places like St. Paul Street with all the bars and stuff. So room and street noise was a non-issue.Room only one phone. Very surprised. And not cordless.No coffeemaker in room. I really don't like that.Otherwise, everything was great.Agreed with previous poster that bare floors seemed strange. But it wasn't bad. And the bathroom floor was heated.We will definitely stay here again. I am VERY surprised but I like this more than I do the QE.\",\n",
       " 'We stayed at the Gault at the end of June and while we had a pleasant experience, something seemed to be lacking, a certain attention to detail. Sometimes we did not receive the turndown service, for example. Also, the rooms have a lot of bare concrete floor which is not pleasing to bare feet (cold and sort of scuffed up and dirty looking). I thought this would not be annoying since the Gault website indicates that slippers are provided, but alas, there were none to be had. We received an excellent restaurant recommendation from the staff, but also got some misinformation as well. So, I would have to agree with the previous poster that attention to some of the service-related details seems a bit off.The general &quot;vibe&quot; of the hotel is rather young (20-30 somethings, guests and staff alike), so I think that what was also lacking for me was a feeling of being a bit out of place. As I look at the reviews here on TA, it seems like the younger crowd really takes to the hotel while some of those older are more lukewarm..... We had dinner at the Nelligan one night and felt more at home there as forty-somethings.',\n",
       " \"What the heck happened to this lovely hotel? Has it become a victim of its success? We stayed here in July, 06 and were very pleasantly surprised. We enjoyed the hotel and the service immensely. Flash forward one year and the results weren't so positive. First the positives: The rooms are huge and unique. The bathrooms are super large, especially the ones with the tubs and showers. The front desk people are very friendly and helpful, so much so that we hate to complain. My wife loved the breakfasts, which are included.The negatives: Where to begin? The raisinet I accidentally dropped on the floor on the first day was still there on the third. Yuck! The room wasn't made until 5 pm one day, even though the &quot;make up the room&quot; sign was on the door from 10 am to 3 pm. And they only cleaned the room after we called concerned that the maid had died, or something. They only give you one bath towel per person unless you call for more. The empty tissue box placed strategically on the night table was not replaced even though it was empty. Had to call the front desk after sneezing. The TV picture was snowy and required fixing. There's no alarm clock or phone books in the rooms. We had to wait 25 minutes for our valeted car because, we were told, they were understaffed. Large functions held in the lobby each night were intrusive.Management should consider this a wake-up call. Train your room staff to clean rooms better, and hire enough people to maintain your four stars. Or drop a star and lower your rates.\",\n",
       " \"Just to second a lot of the other reviews on TripAdvisor, we had two great experiences at Hotel Gault. We have made two long weekend trips to Montreal and found Hotel Gault to be perfect for us for both stays. The location, size of the hotel (small), service, and design were all fabulous! Location is right in the heart of Old Montreal and near a subway station. Service is always wonderful (consierge spent considerable amount of time helping us find restaurants, make reservations and printing out maps for us). My husband loves modern design and was loving Hotel Gault with the polished cement flooring and other such touches. Breakfast is included in the stay and is above and beyond my expecations for a free breakfast (made to order eggs benedict, lox, omlet, etc.) So good that we ate there every morning before heading out for the day.Needless to say, as we already have been there twice, we'd return again a third time.\",\n",
       " \"Stayed at Gault for weekend getaway with my husband. We frequent Old Montreal several times a year for vacation and business. Found Hotel Gault to be just okay . We booked a room to find that it only had a shower. Had to pay extra to upgrade to suite with tub. The suite was modern and very different . Balcony is big and private if you book the best suite otherwise you share your balcony. The curtains, made of organza were torn and the whole place had an office feel to it. Nothing warm or inviting. Breakfast was good and the coffee was hot. Overall I'd say there are better places to stay in Old Montreal and Hotel Gault is only so so in my books.\",\n",
       " \"Stayed at The Gault in a king room on third floor. Very funky and nice. Bedroom/living area curtained off from dressing and bathroom area. Toilet in closet-like space with sliding door and shower next to it with clear door. Sink outside both. Platform bed nice and comfy with a duvet cover. We booked through the hotel's website and it included one dinner. They have a prix fixe menu for meals too. Presentation was great, food was good. Free brkfst very nice too. Ordered omelet from the kitchen to supplement the breads and salads offered. Parking is $25CAD per night. It's in Old Montreal and quite a walk to the downtown area. We did it with no problem but we like to walk. A few museums are nearby, but beware of dog poop all over the sidwalks. Noon check-out is much appreciated.The staff seems to be younger people (20s?) and they were very willing to get you anything you need. Friendly and courteous too.Building was built in 1901 as the first YMCA in North America (plate outside building says so). I would stay here again but would also consider a hotel a little north and few blocks to the west to be closer to the downtown area. Note: The non-Canada resident tax refund program is ending at the end of March. If you do the refund at the airport as you are leaving, you can get cash.\",\n",
       " \"I stayed at the Gault with my boyfriend for two nights at the end of december 2006. It is by far the best hotel I have visited - point of comparison are the Place d'Armes in Montreal, the Germain in Toronto and the Dominion 1912 in Quebec city. The design is absolutely outstanding. The room was very big. The FLOU bed was extremely comfortable and so were the duvet and pillows.The heated floor in the bathroom was well apreciated. The DVD player in the room was useful to watch our dvds - check out the dvd selection in the lobby - and so was the internet connection in the room.The complimentary breakfast was a nice surprise as you could order great hot breakfast from the kitchen and not just a continental breakfast. The staff was courteous and discreet.Overall a charming and romantic experience. I highly recomend it.\",\n",
       " \"We had a fantastic experience at Hotel Gault. I can't remember the last time I stayed in a place where I couldn't find a single flaw. Everything from interior design to hotel staff was impeccable. Our room was incredibly spacious and seriously felt like home away from home. The staff was personable, attentive and helpful with all our requests, from parking our car to recommending and reserving wonderful dining options in the area. We felt like we were visiting some sort of dear friends, that's how well the staff took care of us. I could go on and on. We ended up extending our stay in Montreal and hotel Gault had a lot to do with it.\",\n",
       " 'We just spent the better part of a week at the Hotel Gault in Montreal, celebrating our 20th wedding anniversary, and our postive experiences at this hotel, and in Old Montreal, have left us with such a memorable and joyful celebration. As in Paris, we always prefer a small boutique hotel, and with only 30 diverse rooms in the Hotel Gault, we became acquainted with the friendly, competent, courteous and professional staff, and in all of our interactions with them, we all shared a genuine personal touch to all of our activities. From the time we made our reservations by phone, and until we left by taxi to the airport, every staff member (chefs to attendants) made every encounter a pleasant experience. Our quiet &quot;top 5&quot; room was impecably cleaned each day, excellent toiletries; we were also provided with a hand-written weather report for the next day, along with bottled water on the nightstand. With the excellent location of the Hotel Gault, we leisurely walked, or took the metro everywhere (without fear or safety concerns), and appreciated the non-destructive humanity of the people of this fine city. The majority of our purchases consisted of items (art to clothing) that were creations of local artists, and we never felt cheated or deceived in our discussions and purchases. When we return to Montreal, we will also return to the Hotel Gault, and expect to again enjoy all the courtesies the enthusiastic staff provided to us.',\n",
       " \"Hotel Gault is simply great. It was our second stay there and it hasn't missed a beat in the 2 years since our first visit. Gault now serves lunch and dinner to go along with the included breakfast that they have always offered. ReceptionWe arrived at 1pm and our room was not yet ready (3pm check-in) so we left our vehicle at the curb, they checked our bags for us and then took our vehicle to the car park. We have a full-sized SUV so it had to be parked a block away in a larger garage. Parking was $25CAD/nt. My wife and I walked around Rue St. Paul and grabbed a quick lunch and returned to the hotel at 2:30pm to find that our room was ready. We were then escorted to our room to find that our bags awaited us in the room.The RoomWe booked a corner room. The corner rooms are very spacious with the heated concrete bathroom floors, huge shower with Grohe fixtures and minimalist furniture. The queen-sized bed was comfortable and the rooms contain an ironing board, iron, hairdryer, workstation, flat screen TV with DVD player (movies available in the lobby) and a compact audio system.DiningThe dinner was incredible. A very small and modern menu that reflects the ambience of the hotel. The dining space is small and quiet and the tables overlook gaslit Rue St. Helene. Breakfast is also excellent. There's a cold buffet offering with fresh fruit, baked goods and juices. There are also choices from the kitchen such as omelets with bacon and hash browns. LocationThe hotel is a bit far from the downtown core. It's walkable (for us) but it's a mostly uphill trek to get to St. Catherines' St. Your only a block from the Metro and therefore a block to the underground pedestrian passageways, so once you get a handle of the maps of the underground you can save yourself time and effort navigating the city. Hotel Gault is just 2 streets from Rue St. Paul and a 5 minute walk to Bonsecours and Place Jaques Cartier. Also the Bell Center is approx. a 15 minute walk but just a couple of Metro stops away.\",\n",
       " \"Everything about the hotel was great! We booked a loft suite, which was a good size, very clean with neat furniture. The bathroom was incredible, especially liked the big bathtub and heated floors. Service was excellent - nothing like leaving your car at the front door and not being bothered with ticket stubs to keep track of. When we needed the car, we just called the front desk and asked for it - no problems at all. The breakfast which was included was fantastic - eggs benedict, crepes, whatever you want! The lobby bar was cozy and friendly with wireless internet if you bring your laptop. We booked this hotel based on tripadvisor reviews and were not disappointed at all. Stay here, you won't be sorry!\",\n",
       " \"I brought my husband to Montreal to celebrate his birthday. Thanks to the Hotel Gault, it was a perfect weekend! The staff (Andre, Robert, Phillip and Melinda, to name a few) was very friendly, attentive and extremely helpful. The Hotel's decor is modern but has a very intimate atmosphere. We were given a beautiful room on the 5th floor -- extremely spacious and great view. The bare cement floors tend to get a bit cold (except in the bathroom area where the floors are heated). The restaurant/bar in the lobby was great. Food (we had breakfast and lunch) was good, nice variety. The only &quot;criticism&quot; was that the gym was very small. In fairness though, we didn't even use the gym while there because we were trying to make the most of our two-day stay in Montreal. We would definitely go back to Hotel Gault. We wouldn't stay anywhere else!\",\n",

       " \"This hotel is in the same category as W Montreal &amp; Hotel Nelligan. Both very modern, sleeck, upscale, and hip. The room is very bare with the essentials. They seem not to provide enough clean towels, wash towels, and etc. I had to ask for more. The water, chips, and chocolates in the room were unmarked with prices. So I didn't know if they were complimentary or not.... hence I didn't touch them.You can hear noices from upstairs and next door very easily. All rooms seems to have very high ceilings. All with views of the surrounding buildings. The hotel is only 5 stories high, so don't expect any spectacular views of anything.The breakfast was good, which was complimentary and included waffles and order of eggs if you wanted. All the staffs were friendly and helpful. The beds were extremely confortable. The room was clean and modern. At the summer promotional rate of $249, its hard to go wrong at this hotel. But I believe rates are usually around $400, which I think may be a bit too expensive when comparing to the W Hotel. Not sure if it justifies that price rate... its no four seasons and definitely does not have all the amenties to justify that price.\",\n",

Overall an excellent luxury boutique hotel in a great old city location. Wouldn't hesitate to stay here again. Only minus is only 2 machines in the gym. That said, I never had to wait to use the treadmill...\",\n",
       " \"Okay folks, the Hotel Gault is a great hotel, but I don't understand this hype with all the &quot;best luxury hotel&quot;. The hotel Nelligan, down the street has more amenities and their ambience is much more inline with the luxury theme-same price. I enjoyed staying at Gault and the price is right - $235/night. But I was disappointed by having no drawers to put my clothes in, and the amenities were very basic. If you can get the same price at Nelligan or Le Place de Armes, then we're talking luxury.\",\n",

The staff was wonderful, Andre, the concierge, gave us great recommendations for restaurants and sights to visit. We were always greeted with a smile when we stepped in the front door, or off the elevator, and their only answer to a question was &quot;yes&quot;. As others have said, the beds are very comfortable and the decor and furnishings are warm modern. The hotel is beginning to show a bit of wear, scraped elevator and room doors, a patch of paint missing by our soaking tub, and scuff marks on the room floor. Not a complaint, just an observation. I would not hesitate to stay at the Gault again.',\n",

There were cool gadgets in the room... a fun, height adjustable table(!), stereo, TV, DVD player, heated floor, etc. Location in Old Montreal was excellent. The basilica is only 5-10 minutes down the road and the subway is easy to find (Victoria). Breakfast was included in the rate and was a &quot;help yourself buffet&quot; of breads, juice, jams, pate, cheese, fruit, cereal and also cooked eggs - omlette and benedict are to be recommended! The only criticism we could come up with was that the heated concrete floor was slightly scuffed/marked, but hardly something which would spoil our stay! Definitely recommended.',\n",

The Hotel is very clean, rooms are spacious, all necessary amenities included, breakfast was great and the staff was extremely accomodating.

       " \"I think a dose of realism is required here so let me try to give a balanced review. I read ALL of the reviews and from doing so it's easy to expect some kind of heaven on earth here. But a modern 30 room hotel in the centre of a city like Montreal is unlikely to be THAT good, it just isn't possible. Having said that, I've still given it 5 stars because it's not far off as good as it could be and the things that are not perfect don't knock it down to 4 stars. We are fairly fussy. We stayed at various small inns on our 16 night trip (all with several 5 star reviews on Tripadvisor) and one very expensive hotel at Mont Tremblant. The Gault is a very good place to stay in Montreal. The location is good, Andre is a very personable and helpful guide. We said what we wanted and he booked us 3 excellent meals - Chez L'Epicier (very good food in imaginative dishes in the old town), The Globe (a 'scene' restaurant with a ridiculously noisy DJ, waitresses who look like models and very good food) and the best - O Chalet a new restaurant with a funny 70s camping theme which could have been tacky but actually was rather stylish and the food absolutely superb. Once place we found on our own was for excellent brunch - Le Cartet, 106 Mc Gill.Our room was mid-range, it's admittedly very modern here (minor criticism) but it did have excellent ameneties - a lovely bed, wired free internet access (wifi doesnt work too well through concrete walls), excellent shower, funky storage. Breakfast is a very good buffet but the chairs and tables are not the most practical (minor criticism). The staff are all very friendly and helpful. The location is fine. I've got to say we were rather disappointed with Montreal, perhaps it's over-hyped. The best things we found were various interesting structures - the Geodesic Dome on the island, right out of science fiction; the sports stadium (you can't miss it if you go up to Mont Royal, just look for the spaceship); a building around the corner from the hotel made of coloured glass; the industrial buildings and ships down at the docks. Anyway if you're staying in Montreal this is a very good hotel. If I was going again I'd probably look at other reviews on Tripadvisor but might end up back at the Gault anyway since you can't go wrong there. Hope this helps.\",\n",
       " \"I have traveled all over the world and stayed in many high-end hotels and can unequivically put the Hotel Gault easily in my top 3 of hotel experiences. This was my first visit to Montreal and while I loved the city I didn't want to leave my room! I don't want to re-hash what everyone else has said about this great boutique hotel (and I agree with all the positive comments), so I will just give my personal bullet points. The staff is genuinely friendly and caring--probably the nicest staff I have ever encountered. They all know your name and treat you like family. They are very gay-friendly and welcoming to all. The loby at first glance seems spare and minimalist, but gradually shows its true warmth and comfort. The breakfast is excellent--they will make you anything you desire (&quot;free&quot; with room). Nice little bar for a cappucino or a preprandial libation (and they serve Voss water--my favorite). Spend the extra $$ for one of the &quot;essential top five&quot; rooms--private, quiet, and your own balcony. While I missed the soaking tub that is in some of the other rooms, the balcony and views made up for it. The room was very NY loft-like but very &quot;homey.&quot; The bed was great and the linens superb. Great mini-sound system and lots of storage space. Loved the heated bathroom floor (which can set by you). Superior sound control--NO city or neighbor noise. I stayed in 520 and never wanted to leave! Great location, close to old Montreal and great restaurants. Go have a drink and the elegant room in the St. James and either of the two bars of the W (both short distance walking). Remember...wine is VERY VERY expensive (2-10 times the price in the states). I carried a few bottles with me from the US because of this--but splurge for a glass of Champagne in the St James bar--beautiful and elegant (don't miss the deal at &quot;happy hour&quot; drinks and appetizer pairings for $20 CA!) Another thing not to miss is pizza on Youville St at Pizzaiolle (sp?). A bit of a walk but worth it is Restaurant Cavali--authentic and heavenly Italian fare. Hotel Gault is the only place I would stay in Montreal and can't wait to go back. You will love it!\",\n",

It's on a little street two minutes from Place D'Armes and two minutes from a metro station, so both quiet and convenient.The staff were professional and relaxed at the same time, and happily did everything we asked of them: gave us great suggestions for places to eat (like Holder, a very good resto-pub around the corner on McGill), pointed out interesting things to see in the city, let us use their computer to print out our boarding passes, let us sprawl in their lobby even after we'd checked out...all without any of the pretention or aloofness that you get from many high-end hotels.I can't imagine a better hotel experience. I can't imagine staying anywhere else in Montreal either.\",\n",
       " 'Over the last six months, my team and I have tried eight high-end hotels in Montreal. I do not pretend to speak for them, this is purely my view. But I do feel passionately that this is one of the better hotels I have stayed at.The lobby has an open, well-designed but homely feel. The concierge took time to explain individual features about each of our rooms (there are only 19 in the whole hotel). The library seems to be a particularly comfortable place for meetings. Though they are a little light on the books, but make up for it with the video/magazine selection.Each room is unique. I found mine had an excellent blend of design and warmth despite the minimalist effort that had been put into it.Service is excellent overall. Attention paid to detail - helps when there so few rooms. The only thing I found annoying was the air conditioning (despite being quiet) could not be turned off at night. Excellent bed, very good pillows.',\n",
       " \"After having read all the wonderful reviews, I was expecting my stay at the Gault to be the &quot;summit&quot; of a two-week Canada trip. However, I was rather disappointed, both by certain aspects of the room and by the service. This has been the only time that I have disagreed so significantly with the Tripadvisor rating.Room problems: several lights didn't work, the safe was broken, the toilet seat was about to break &amp; there were no clothes hangers at all (strange for a luxury hotel!)Service problems: the people at reception and at breakfast were very friendly. BUT, I was not so thrilled with the overbearing attentions of the concierge Andr: for many travelers, advice on restaurants and extended anecdotes on the city may be welcome, but that advice shouldn't be forced on (more independent-minded) travelers who know the city. At one point, I resorted to running away when he approached me for the umpteenth time.At the end of our Canada trip, I found that both the Germain in Toronto and the Auberge St Antoine in Qubec City were superior hotels (with regard to service &amp; accommodation).\",\n",
       " \"I dont understand all these rave reviews. I stayed here last March and apart from being locked in the bathroom for fifteen minutes due to a faulty lock this hotel is very basic and totally overrated. The chairs in the rooms are like office chairs very uncomfortable and you could not watch tv from the bed as it didn't swivel. Staff were not overly concerned about my locked in problem and only offered minor compensation. Breakfasts and location are good thats about it. No one to help bring luggage in on arrival.I prefer the St James, as do the Rolling Stones!\",\n",
       " 'Hello, as a seasoned traveler for both business and pleasure I just had to write and say that this is by far the best hotel I have ever stayed at. The rooms are modern but very cozy with every amenity you could ever need and more. However, what truly makes a hotel is the staff and service. The Gault staff is most courteous, professional, congenial and polite group of people I have ever done business with. They were so polite and treated my wife with such attention and respect that we were both almost embarrassed by how polite and helpful these people were. I am definitely going back. One tip though, the room rate can be a little pricey so I strongly suggest that you book online in advance and take advantage of their online deals which often enough are at 50% off the regular rack rates. Five stars!!!!!',\n",
       " \"Don't waste time looking any further. Book here, you will not be disappointed. Perfect location for Old Montreal. Perfect stay.\",\n",
       " \"We went to a wedding and stayed at this beautiful hotel in Montreal. We highly recommend it. At first glance the lobby and its modern furniture makes you think you are going to be in a very &quot;stuffy&quot; and &quot;hipster&quot; place. But the Hotel Gault is not like that at all. The staff is so warm and inviting that you end up wanting to stay there forever!The furnishings are very modern, rooms are huge, the breakfast/brunch is delicious and very healthy. The lobby serves as a restaurant for lunch and breakfast and as a quiet bar at night.  We especially loved the heated floors in the hotel rooms. Most all the rooms had balconies; some balconies were larger than others. Most balconies were narrow, which meant that you could not sit on the balconies. However, the windows were huge and elegant; with beautiful flower boxes. The breeze that came through added to the wonderful environment in the room. We were quite impressed with the staff. They made our stay at Hotel Gault so pleasant. We'll definitely go back there for a visit!\",\n",
       " 'This hotel was amazing! Friendly and helpful staff. Great location. Fabulous room. Would stay there again in a heartbeat.',\n",
       " \"I have actually stayed in this hotel 3 times over the past several years. I first went shortly after they opened. I have traveled all around the world on over 60 international trips in 3 years (all vacation). This hotel is head and shoulders above most hotels I have been to. It's ultra cool and has excellent amenities. More importantly, the staff is amazing and goes the extra mile. The last time I went I remember that I called down to ask if they could recommend any places that delivered food. They gave me some phone numbers. I asked about one of the restaurants and they didn't have a menu so they went down the street to go get one! Also, I had to mail some letters and didn't have stamps but offered to buy some stamps. Again, they didn't have any stamps there but offered to mail them for free. The room I stayed in was great. Once I stayed in a &quot;Studio&quot; and another I stayed in the &quot;etcetera&quot; and the other the &quot;Terra&quot;. All were great. The breakfast buffet in the morning was really great. They were always very friendly about directions, parking and the service was head and shoulders better than most places. One night I had a date with a girl I met and I went to buy a bottle of champagne. Someone that came in for the turndown service noticed it and immediately offered to bring a bucket with ice and even brought champagne flutes up. I ended up leaving an expensive Prada belt in the room when I left and I expected it to be long gone. I called and they said that the cleaning lady found it. They immediately Fed-ex'ed it to my office the next day.I can't recommend this hotel enough. When I go back to Montreal I wouldn't stay anywhere else. mike@apartmentsba.com\",\n",
       " \"The Gault is the real deal when it comes to service and cool. I spent 8 nights there for a long conference and every night spent in the Gault was a treat. They are THE NICEST staff I have ever encountered in any hotel in the world (and I have stayed in over 40 countries). Special kudos to the front desk for remembering our names every time we came in the door. Be careful what rooms you get. We were in the best rooms in the hotel, but some are small on the bottom floors. Splurge for the fourth or fifth floor rooms. The modern decor is way cool and very welcoming; very modern, but incredibly comfortable. The only nit I would pick is the ridiculous chairs for the dining area. They nearly killed three people while I was there so watch out for tripping. The rate includes breakfast and all the various coffee drinks you can consume. Remember to order off the menu for breakfast. If you like your eggs 'American' standard, ask for your omelette well done, otherwise they are a bit wet (keep in mind a breakfast like this would set you back at least $25 CAD elsewhere.) Use your tub if you get one, it's way cool after a busy day of shopping. Go shopping on Ste Catherine street, especially in the higher end shops. There are some real treasures. The Gault is one of the finest hotels I have stayed in, bar none. Not a grand hotel in that tradition, but warm, welcoming people make it the experience you should not miss in Montreal. Magnifique!\",\n",
       " 'Just got back from a wonderful 3 day stay. I cannot say enough good things about this hotel. The staff is super. Andre the concierge goes beyond efforts to help you, even taking you outside the building to point out directions. That is not to say the rst of the staff is not just as helpful. The rooms are modern, yet comfortable. We had a terra room which has a bathroom as big as some of the hotel rooms I have been in. The area is quiet, and you actually can walk to downtown. The breakfast is something to look forward to each morning.. make sure you order from the kitchen. The only drawback is housekeeping... turndown service is sporadic. They tend to come just when one is getting ready for dinner, and when sent away, they never return. There is no need to look anywhere else for a stay in Montreal.',\n",
       " 'I have travelled often in my life though have never before felt compelled to write a review of any of my accomodations. I hesitate now only because I wish to keep this gem to myself - however, since the beans have already been spilled, I will elaborate on the beauty of the Gault. What a magnificant retreat! The lobby is sleek but not unwelcoming, the staff warm and incredibly attentive to any needs. They readily provided directions, made reservations, and answered all of our questions. Service at the front desk and at the bar was efficient and thorough. The rooms are spacious and quiet and the bed is remarkable. Never have I slept so well while away from home! All the luxuries and creature comforts one could want for while away from home were provided, from the lush bathrobes to the umbrella hanging thoughtfully in the wardrobe. Breakfast is included in the room rate and for an additional $5, can be had in the room. It was a delight each morning. I could never stay anywhere in Montreal again...I am already searching for an excuse to find myself back at the Gault!',\n",
       " \"We just returned from 3 fabulous nights at the Hotel Gault. We were 2 couples (40's) looking to let loose and eat, drink and sightsee our way around the city! We loved our &quot;loft&quot; style King room with high ceilings, beautiful fabrics and tasteful furnishings - very chic!! Our very large bathroom included a tub big enough for two, a separate water closet and a glass enclosed shower. The radiant heated floor was a nice touch for the chilly mornings. Housekeeping was wonderful and we never had ANY issues. Bathroom amenities were perfect, towels were fluffy and a robe was provided - nothing was lacking. The location of the hotel is perfect for exploring Old Montreal. Notre Dame is right down the street and we were able to find numerous bars, restaurants and bistros right in the area - far too many choices for a weekend. We particularly enjoyed Boris Bistro for dinner (around the corner on McGill) and the Cobalt Bar and the Nelligan Hotel for cocktails (on St. Paul). However, if you want to venture further, concierge is more than willing to offer up suggestions and ideas. They will even print various restaurant menus off the internet for you. The small bar at the Gault is perfect for a cocktail at the beginning or end of your night (we did both!). There is also a nice fireplace separating the reception/bar area and a comfortable reading room in the back. The Gault has tons of DVD's for rent and lots of books/magazines to peruse if you're hanging out on the couches. As mentioned in the other reviews...the breakfast was awesome! A beautiful buffet selection is offered daily along with a made to order choices. The food and service was top notch all the way. It's a nice touch that the entire breakfast is included in the room rate. If you eat too much at breakfast, there is a small health club in the basement with a good treadmill, an elliptical and some free weights - just enough to sneak in a quick 30 minute workout. The metro station is very close to the Gault and a good way to move around the city. We used the Metro 1/2 the time and then relied on short taxi rides in the evening - never more than $10/15 to get us from point A to point B. I cannot express enough how friendly the staff was during our entire stay! They should be proud of the impression they made on the 4 of us! We will return.\",\n",
       " \"Read all the reviews on this site, which helped us select the Gault. We stayed in a Studio, one of the largest options. Very clean, extremely modern. We are not modern furniture people but felt it would be fun for a change. If you are really into this type of look, this place would be fantastic for you. Lots of new stuff but also valuable stuff from the 40's-50's and 60's. The bed is incredibly comfortable. We loved our bathroom (which for us included a tub) Our studio had a mini fridge, wet bar and microwave. The living area was seperated from the bedroom by a custom built wood piece which did not reach the ceiling, but was really more of a divider. The TV/DVD was located on that, on a swivel that could face either room area. If you want something supremely cushy and comfy, this is not your place. OUr studio was wonderful but not the most Cozy thing we have stayed in. Having said that, it was fun to 'try something different on' since we are huge antique people. The lobby is terrific. Neat bar and surrounding area. Breakfasts were very good, and we found that we ordered the hot breakfast items every morning. Service very gracious there, expecially if you remember that although it is 'free', the server deserves a tip. Things were replenished regularly. The Gault is on the edge of Old Montreal- get your bearings so you don't miss the busier streets of Old Montreal. The staff was enormously friendly. Also, take the hotel's address and number with you if you are taking cabs. Not all of the drivers have discovered the Gault yet. We LOVED Andre. He has genuine passion for the hotel and the area. But all the front desk/concierge folks were very professional and friendly and helpful. We had no problems with housekeeping. Left our room, put out the sign and when we came back it was all set. It's true they don't change the linens every day but why tax the environment with the extra soap and hot water. If we threw towels on the floor, they were replaced. If we hung them, they were not. Fine with us. We ordered drinks and apps room service- quick and efficient. Husband forgot his razor, brought one up. Staff always inquired as to whether we enjoyed a recommended restaurant etc. We can only give this place high marks, but most especially because of the people who work there.\",\n",
       " \"The other trip advisor reviews do not lie. This is a real find. Everyone on the staff was so accomodating i every way. The room had minimal decor, but the amazing bed and comfy linens made up for it! nice shower and bathroom too. The breakfast was out of this world (don't miss the French toast or the croissants). The Gault Martinis at the bar were fantastic! Great location, we walked everywhere! I can't say enough good things about this hotel. Feel free to email me with other questions.\",\n",
       " \"First of all, I wanted a room with a terrace but it wasn't available. I didn't realize that all their rooms have doors/windows that open completely that allow fresh air in and transports you to another time. Below passed a horse drawn tourist cairrage over cobble stoned streets and I was completely taken. A minor drawback was the maid service that came in at turn down service time rather than the morning while we were out but one call to the front desk immediatley rectified the situation with a follow up to see if it was to our liking. THe lobby is always quiet but homey (if modern). THere was a quiet coctail party the night beofre we left and it was unobtrusive to the guests. The staff was super. Incredible Lychee Martinis by Adrianne who seemed to always have been there. Everyone in the reviews talk about the staff and they really are the best asset of the hotel. THe hotel was pricey but I knew that when I booked. No surprises. THe breakfast the next day always seemed worth it in the end. We were never more than a $5 cab ride from anywhere and the metro too was near. The beds were very comfortable and made you want to sleep longer. THe heated bathroom floor does work quite well. I have stayed at W's elsewhere but this is taken to the different level. It's not clubby or young. THe decor may be a bit cold but it was actually condusive to just lounging around downstairs. THe black clad staff were so quiet but always at beck and call. My best hotel experience.\",\n",
       " \"What can I add to the other reviews? My girlfriend and I stayed here for two nights and wish we could have stayed longer. The minimalist room is maybe not to everyone's taste, but we liked it nonetheless; it had everything that you could possibly need including the heated bathroom floor! Breakfast was excellent, and for those of you that find the normal North American pancakes too stodgy, their crepes are delicious, thin and ever so slightly crispy. The best aspect of the hotel was the service though, for such a &quot;cool&quot; hotel you would expect an air of pretentiousness, far from it, the staff are extremely polite and will do their best to cater to your every whim. Andr knows everything there is to know about Montral including the all important restaurants and attrations, and will send you to all the right places, especially those just off the beaten track. Should we ever return to Montral we will definitely look this hotel up again.\",\n",
       " \"What can I say? what a hotel, we loved the place. Service, the best we've had in a hotel; Breakfast was a fantastic selection of hot/cold plates; room was massive with all one would require in it; bathroom, likewise. Located in the Old Port area, easy to get to many attractions and lots of restaurants etc. But what makes a place is it's staff, and they were all superb. When I needed to use a computer and did not have one (on my honeymoon) they supplied a laptop to us for free for as long as we needed it and they have a great wi-fi connection in the lobby. A great hotel in a great city, we chose it because of the reviews in Tripadvisors. We'll be back......\",\n",
       " \"Design meets comfort. Staff makes you feel like you're home. They are truly the best. The hotel doesn't really have a restaurant; they have a kitchen. A kitchen that makes fabulous tasty food 24/7, wonderful breakfasts, a nice little bar downstairs. Just what you need to be comfortable, nothing you don't. The rooms are clean, modern well-equipped, but so, so comfortable. I travel here for business (have tried the Vogue, Le Germain, St. Paul but have come back here now for two years) but I would definitely bring my spouse back here for a weekend getaway. Only drawback is you have to walk a little for restaurants/stores, but not far and it's a neat old neighborhood, and of course the staff is always willing to give you a good steer. Le Gault, c'est magnifique!!\",\n",
       " 'Just returned from four nights at the Gault. While the staff, breakfast and location were great, housekeeping was a disaster. We checked in to find clipped toenails on the floor and hairs in the shower. Despite requests with the front desk to have our room serviced late morning/early afternoon, housekeeping would show up at 5 PM daily, a time when we, and most guests, were resting up and showering before going out for the evening. Used glasses were never replaced, an empty tissue box not replaced, sheets on the bed not changed unless requested. paint peeling from the shower ceiling. This was in a $400/night suite. I would expect better at a Motel 6. Never again!!!!!!!!!',\n",

       " 'My family just spent 5 nights at the Gault. This is one mod little hotel that earns its good reviews. This boutique property is fun, stylish, well located for leisure visitors, and unlike so many other trendy hotels of the moment, it hits on all the key hospitality cylinders without a single backfire. Our room was spacious, with an extra comfy kingsize bed and a rollaway for junior. The design element is big here, so if you like modern, the Gault is going to be to your taste. Minimalist decor, but cozy and bright. Breakfast is a treat as many other reviewers have noted. Service is attentive and friendly, but not obtrusive. The Gault pays attention to all the little details that can make or break a hotel stay. It is consistently just a little better than you might expect and the knowledgeable staff pulls it off with composure and elan. Highly recommended.',\n",
       " 'This was one of our best hotel stays ever. The room was superb, the staff delightful and the breakfast a gourmet treat! We would return to Montreal just to stay at the Gault...',\n",
       " 'We got the first of several pleasant surprises at check-in, when we learned that we had been upgraded to a suite (complete with wraparound terrace) with no increase in rate. We loved everything (well, almost everything) about the Hotel Gault: the clever, open-plan design in our suite; the magnificent breakfasts; the luxurious deep bathtub; and most of all, the friendly, helpful, professional staff (special mention to Caroline, customer service superstar). The hotel is extraordinarily well located in the historic district but also on the edge of downtown Montreal. Only minor peeve: although there is excellent wi-fi service in the lobby, we had problems with the high-speed internet connection in our room.',\n",
       " 'Really a great hotel. Rooms are comfortable and huge. Love the bed and huge tub. Daily breakfast was great- leisure,great offerings and could read numerous papers or watch ET or Nemo on the flat screen tv. Staff is very nice and the location is great for strolling around,shopping or getting a bite to eat. Only thing I thought was strange when I was there was the entrance and lack of staff helping you get your bags up the stairs or holding the door open- not a big deal for a smaller hotel but something I noticed. The streets can be a bit noisy as there was lots of contruction going on when I was there and the heated cement floors will pop and crack quite loudly after turning them up or off. Most people I am sure would not notice this- as I am a light sleeper. They did a really nice job with everything. Restaurant called AREA around the way is absolutely excellent!',\n",
       " 'the service was wexcellent - professional hotel people who tired to serve the guest - from the first moment i came in after a lousy cab ride and the guy at the desk said - would you like to sit and relax and have a cafe while we get your room ready - everybody there had the same attitude. and then the physical feature - although ultra moderne and i was a little bit nervous about that - it turns out that everything wasd provided and the comfort level was high.',\n",
       " \"My wife and I stayed at the Gault during Grand Prix weekend (our second stay here) and what a great way to enjoy the weekend. Close enough to the action by Metro, taxi or on foot, yet a world away from the crowds. The other reviews are accurate, we really can't add much. When we checked out, they asked us to complete a survey. One question asked was &quot;improvements needed?&quot;. Our reply - NONE.\",\n",
       " 'My wife and I have travelled to many places here in Canada, the United States, and Europe, and Hotel Gault was without a doubt our most enjoyable hotel experience to-date. The service is in a word: exceptional. The front desk staff were always genuinely friendly, helpful, and went out of their way to make us feel as if we were the only guests at the hotel. For example one morning after breakfast my wife and I commented on how we liked the look of furniture in the lobby. Without hesitation the concierge called up the owner of the hotel to find out who designed it, then successfully located a local Montreal store which carried it, and provided us with a map on how to get there so we could check it out. What impressed us most about this was that my wife and I are by no means big-shots. Were both around 30 years old, and got a package deal on the internet and decided to splurge a little. Yet, the staff treated us as very special guests, in a completely genuine and sincere way. I cant emphasise this enough. The breakfast was superb, as was the decor in the rooms. Our king bed provided us with a more restful and comfortable sleep then we get at home.If you want the definitive &quot;boutique hotel&quot; experience this is it. Go and enjoy!',\n",
       " 'Three college friends met for a long weekend in Montreal, and we were treated to a wonderful stay at Hotel Gault. This boutique hotel is clean, modern and chic. Everything about it far exceeded our expectations--great location, clean and very chic, delicious breakfast. And the service is exceptional. The staff are knowledgable, friendly and very helpful, especially Andre who was there before we even realized we needed his help! I would absolutely return, and I have already recommended this little gem of a hotel.',\n",

I am fortunate to have visited many a fine hotel worldwide and found this gem to be spectacular in every detail. Staff and service was sterling. The breakfast in the lobby is not to miss. The design and furnishings are incredible. Very minimalistic, modern yet very comfortable. The room is an architectural dream. Perfect location in the old town of Montreal. No attention to detail has been spared. I can't rave enough.\",\n",
       " 'What a terrific hotel! We stayed for three nights, and were not disappointed. As mentioned in other reviews, the staff is exceptionally friendly and helpful (and young!), with great dinner and shopping suggestions tailored to what we were interested in. The hotel is clean and modern, but still feels comfortable and romantic. Although the hotel was completely booked the weekend we stayed, it never seemed crowded or busy; a feeling of relaxed (but hip!) elegance was maintained at all time. We stayed in an &quot;Essential&quot; room, which is the least expensive, but the room was plenty big. No dressers, though, so prepare to keep your clothes on shelving. The shower was wonderful, big with great pressure. The breakfast is amazing: plentiful and delicious, with hot items cooked to order. The hotel is located in a quiet part of Old Montreal. It is a mostly business district so on the weekends it is very peaceful and private, yet the bustle of the more touristy section of Old Montreal (which we pretty much avoided) is only a few blocks away, as is the nearest Metro station. All in all, a fabulous time. We would definitely stay there again.',\n",
       " 'We travel a fair amount and generally stay in nice hotels. Based on reviews in Trip Advisor, I picked the Hotel Gault for our 4-day vacation. It is a fantastic place! It is a small hotel, but everything about it is done big. The modern styling is wonderful. The rooms are large and very comfortable. The breakfast every morning was delicious and the staff was superb. We will stay there any time we travel to Montreal, no question.If you stay there, three other suggestions:About three blocks away is a wonderful little bistro called Olive and Gourmando. An excellent spot for lunch.For dinner we went to a Greek seafood restaurant called Milos (or Millos?). It was about 5 miles away and requires a cab. While an expensive meal, every course served was to die for. If you can afford to splurge, make this a stop.Less wonderful, but much less expensive was a place called Holders. It was about two blocks from the hotel and offered a nice selection of food. We both went with Italian and were very happy.It all made for an excellent vacation!',\n",
       " \"I just spent an incredible weekend in Montreal and stayed three nights at the Hotel Gault. The staff, the room, the food, attention to detail was beyond expectations. I really was sad when we checked out, although they even did a great job on that as well by bringing the car to the front and loading our baggage while we ate a delicious breakfast. The room was spacious, beautifully decorated, lots of light and the heated bathroom floor was a treat. The bed was super comfortable and everything was very clean. They had prepared flowers for my fiancee prior to our arrival. There was a minor detail however. there was a noise from the vent overhead that sounded like dripping water in the duct. It wasn't often and I tuned it out after a bit but was a little annoying. I never bothered to say anything so I won't fault them for it and might have been specific to the room.After a long day of walking the streets of montreal one evening, we rented movies and they made popcorn and tea for us to enjoy. They quickly brought it to our room and set the tv and brought in the munchies.The staff, by the way, were the most helpful, nicest people. They always, genuinely, smiled and wished us a good evening/day when we passed by or asked how things were. It prompted me to send them a thank you note upon my return.I'll be back next time I'm in Montreal on vacation.Thanks hotel gault for a memorable weekend.\",\n",
       " 'I stayed at Hotel Gault for one night and did not want to leave, definately worth the money. The service was better then excellent!!! Great very spacious rooms and as soon as you think of something you need that you forgot they have it. I highly recommend hotel Gault to anyone traveling for business or pleasure.',\n",
       " 'A business/pleasure trip took me to the Hotel Gault in April 2005. What a wonderful place to stay ! I travel a great deal, especially in eastern Canada. Hotel Gault will be my first choice in Montreal. The staff made me feel like a family member. Andre is magnificent and very helpful. The staff is multi-lingual and patient and helpful in such matters. The rooms are very cleverly designed and are comfortable, attractive and accomodating. The location in Oldtown gives very good access to business, travel and entertainment needs. Ask Andre anything and he will help. I suggest diner at Restaurant Laloux. Stay at Hotel Gault and you will certainly enjoy your business or pleasure visit. It is smaller than most luxury hotels. That adds to the comfort and personal touch. Compared to Sutton Place (Toronto) or Chateau Lorier in Ottawa, the Hotel Gault has the same comfort and accomodtions, but they are applied in a more personal way.',\n",
       " 'My wife Lili and I just returned from a charming Easter Weekend in Francophone Montreal at the excellent Hotel Gault. What everyone says about the breakfast is true: Wow. The buffet alone is outstanding with offerings of pate, cheeses, fruits and croissants. But then you get an additional choice of offerings from the menu which are terrific.Lili and I send along personal thanks to outstanding staff Caroline and Dominique who gracefully hosted us. Caroline printed out individual informative reports on local bakeries, restaurants, museums, and shopping. Caroline made terrific dinner reservations and answered all of our endless questions with a smile.We found the room decore to be aesthetically interesting AND comfortable which is rare for that modern-design look. We had room 430 which is one of the rooms with a stand-alone bath tub -- well worth it.The hotel is located in what is termed &quot;old Montreal&quot; which has the feeling of a Tribeca or Soho which is in the process of being gentrified. The neighborhood is centrally located to points of interest, nearby the metro and offers very cool shopping and two great boulangeries.One other quick note: I am an avid reader and huge fan of books and magazines on architecture, photography and interior design. There is an entire library to this effect replete with fireplace.We will definitely stay there again.',\n",

We stayed for 7 nights at the Auberge Saint Antoine in Quebec, which was lacking service and cleanliness and it was a bliss when we arrived by taxi at the hotel Gault. The staff rushed to carry our suitcases-they were so fast the cab driver did not have time to get off the car.The check-in was effortless - they even asked us where we were going to eat as it was Valentine's day and immediatly booked us in a restaurant that was excellent.The bedroom was awsomeThe breakfast was out of this world by the quality and the presentation. And it is included in the price of the room! we asked to have it delivered to our room (for only 5 CAD) and it was served on a table! amazingWe sadly left - especially as it costed much less than the St Antoine (a rip off) and we felt at home.\",\n",

       " \"Hotel Gault combines the friendliness and comfort of a B&amp;B, w/ top notch staff and incredibly designed interiors. No snobbery here! We needed a quick weekend getaway from Chicago and I felt like I was staying in a friend's New York City Loft. Staff member, Andre was extra attentive,( like an old friend) telling us the History of the building as well as suggestions for shopping, eating, etc. Great location, a quiet street within walking distance of the Indian cafe, Gandhi (Andre's fav), coffee shops, cafes, boutiques and a great chocolatier shop run by an elderly French couple. (Nadine will give you a sample)Beds extremely comfortable, nice wine selection of wine, while lounging in the library area and delicious breakfast,( try the benedict.) Asked if was OK to bring our son on our next visit, No problem and even said they could hire a babysitter for us. We'll be back to the Hotel Gault with our son on our next visit. If you want to try something different w/ lots of style and comfort this definitely should be on your list. This is such a great value!\",\n",
       " \"Especially for our first trip to Montreal, the Hotel Gault was a friendly, sophisticated home I would go back to again and again. The building's modern furnishings are balanced beautifully by the original facade, the food is delicious, and the staff is unparalleled in their helpfulness and charm. It's located in one of the most interesting parts of the city.\",\n",
       " \"Our experience at Hotel Gault has been great from start to finish. First of all, when we got to the hotel, we found out that we had been upgraded to a larger room for no additional charge. The room was wonderful- huge, clean, stylish, excellent bed and linens, high-tech tv and sound system, wonderful bathroom with a large bathtub, etc, etc... The staff could not be more helpful and nice and went out of their way to make sure that our stay was pleasant. The breakfast (which was inclued in the price) was wonderful as well, it included a very nice buffet as well as a hot selection which was not only delicious but also presented in a very beautiful way.I have stayed in another high-end hotel in Montreal, but this one is by far much better. I can't wait to go back!\",\n",
       " \"This is a fabulous hotel, with an even more fabulous staff. When we arrived, after a bit of a struggle finding it due to an error on my part with the address, a staff member just coming on duty saw us unloading the taxi from down the block, and rushed forward to help us and escort us in. This set the tone for the entire stay, with staff always going out of the way to be helpful. They gave us several good restuarant suggestions, and were able to get us reservations at places that I couldn't. And may I say a word about the bed? The most comfortable, bar none, that I have ever, ever slept in. Great breakfast. Huge, exquiste bathroom with heated floor, separate tub like a huge gravy boat, and large sized shower. If you appreciate great architecture and design, you will love the Hotel Gault. I can't wait to go back!\",\n",
       " \"My wife and I decided to reserve a room at the Gault for four nights (9-27 to 10-1-2004) because of the great reviews noted on TripAdvisor. Conclusion: they are entirely justified. Excellent, quiet location, amazingly knowledgeable, friendly and helpful staff, comfortable room with unique amenities. The full breakfast is delicious and is included in the price of the room. One can easily get spoiled by staying at the Gault. We thought its &quot;minimalist&quot; but &quot;no corners cut&quot; design made for a great and enjoyable ambiance. Our stay occurred during Montral's &quot;Fashion Week.&quot; One night it turned out that famed Montreal designer Ranata Morales chose the hotel's lobby and bar for a party to introduce her new designs. She joined with the Gault's in inviting its few non-fashion week guests to attend. We went and had a blast. It became apparent when we checked in that the Gault has a true &quot;guests first&quot; policy, and it showed in many, many ways while we were there. We'd love to return there.\",\n",
       " \"My wife and I enjoyed a dirty weekend in Montreal recently. Hotel Gault was the perfect venue - the staff is incredibly friendly, the hotel is cool and austere without feeling cold or intimidating. The included breakfast is tremendous. And the DVD collection and popcorn delivered to your room ensure that no rainy day is wasted. We can't recommend it highly enough.\",\n",
       " \"We just spent a wonderful weekend at the Hotel Gault, which exceeded all expectations. Although the decor is stylishly stark, the rooms were also very luxurious, with excellent bed and linens, top of the line stereo and visual equipment, fine bath products and extremely spacious. Breakfast was a combination of buffet and al a carte served items; could also have a full breakfast via room service for an extra $5.Due to the slightly &quot;off the beaten track&quot; location (but three blocks from the sights), we were able to sleep peacefully with the floor to ceiling windows open, woken late morning by the sound of horse's hooves as the hotel is on the carriage tour circuit. The juxtaposition of Old World meets cutting edge chic was very charming. We'll definitely return.\",\n",
       " 'Although I travel a great deal for business and pleasure, I can truly say that I have never had a better hotel experience than when I stayed at the Hotel Gault!

The design is exquisite, our room was huge and had an unbelievable bathroom with heated floors and an exposed brick wall behind the bed. The staff were very helpful and the breakfast was great. The location is wonderful, in a quiet corner of Old Montreal. As a native Montrealer I usually stay with family when I visit Montreal...too bad as I would love to stay at the Gault more often!',\n",

My wife and I just spent the weekend there and found (i) our room to be as comfortable as any room we have ever stayed in (and we have been in top hotels around the world) (ii) the staff consistently went the extra mile (and seemed genuinely pleased to be doing so); and (iii) the design touches were exquisite. Our stay was flawless -- we loved the complementary breakfast too. The location is conveniently off the beaten track (but a short walk to the heart of the Old City) so there were no crowd or noise issues even on weekend nights in June. We will return.',\n",

The rooms are absolutely beautiful, and very good price my boy friend and I just pay $169 USD a night and we got a supreme service. If you go and stay there you will surprise how nice the stuff members and how polite and helpful. I strongly recommend this hotel to all of my friend. I love staying my, I wish there is more hotel like hotel Gault.',\n",

In the back there is a reading room with a fireplace, dozens of design/art/architecture magazines and a DVD library. Our room was spacious, with an open floor plan, the bathroom and closet spaces were separated by floor to ceiling curtains. The bed was comfortable, nice selection of amenities, flat screen TV/DVD player/CD player/bath robes. The fitness room was small but had excellent equipment.

From the moment we arrived til the time we had to sadly check out they were like family. They defined what service is all about. I cannot describe the hotel because it is extremely unique and has won all sorts of design awards. In fact, it is the coolest place we have ever stayed. (And we have been to some really great places) It is super quiet, romantic, and you'll feel as though you have the place all to your self. Heated bathroom floors with a shower roomy enough for five. An extremely comfortable bed and pillows. Large French windows that open to the street below lets you watch the horsedrawn carriages pass by. And just think, you could have stayed at the Marriott instead. We look forward to returning to montreal sooner rahter than later just so we can return to the Gault and our friends.\",\n",

Breakfast was included in the price of our room and was wonderful everyday.\",\n",
       " \"i was with some friends while we had our easter holiday on montreal and since we were looking for a cheaper hotel....Hotel Park Avenue is the place to go....you'll have a bed to sleep in the night, since most of the day we were in the town...close to the bus station so you have the access to the city..\",\n",
       " \"My husband and I were spending a couple of nights in Montreal and were just looking for a room to sleep in, nothing fancy. I was hoping just for a clean, simple room, in a relatively good location. Unfortunately, this hotel came nowhere near our low expectations. It was quite disgusting. The air conditioning in first room we were given wasn't working so they offered us another room, where the air conditioning did work, but it was very loud. The window looked onto a dark very small courtyard. The room was dirty (literally crumbs and garbage on the nightstand, hairs on the sheets). The bathroom was so small, that you had to stand sideways in the shower or else your shoulders would touch the wall and shower curtain (and I'm a small woman). The toilet area was so narrow there was no room for a toilet paper holder, so the roll was just placed on the back of the toilet tank. I didn't like to take my shoes off for fear of what might be on the carpet. We tried the fan once, but it shook so much I thought it was going to fly off the ceiling and land on the bed. We put the &quot;please clean the room&quot; sign on the room one day when leaving at 9AM and when we came back at 6:30 PM it hadn't been made up. So we asked the front desk and they gave us new towels, but that was it. The explanation was that they only had one housekeeper so they hadn't gotten to our room yet (at 6:30 PM!!).Overall the location was pretty good for what we wanted, but I would absolutely not stay there again. It came out to $80 a night, and wasn't worth half that.\",\n",
       " \"So, we get there and they're like &quot;I'm sorry, the room you've booked (the one with two full sized beds) is too dirty, so we can't let you stay there&quot;. Things happen, we understand, but we assumed that we'd either A) receive an upgrade at no additional charge for our inconvenience or B) receive a downgrade but at a hefty discount. What happened is we received a downgrade to one full sized bed and a cot, they knocked $5 off the price. However, if we had booked the same room in advance, it would have been $20 cheaper. We were a little irked, but we were still willing to give the hotel a go.So, we get up to the room, which is fairly dirty but not any real horror, drop our stuff there and go out for the night. It's a bit of a walk to downtown Montreal, but it wasn't that bad. Come that night, me and my friend took off our clothes to put on pajamas and left our clothes in the bathroom. When we woke up the next morning, all our clothes were soaked. We don't know if the toilet ran or there was a leak or what, but it was disgusting. Would not ever stay there again, would never recommend to a friend, will avoid at all costs.\",\n",
       " \"The room so called Superior room is a crowded and dark, 10 years of haven't been vacuumed carpet room with a filthy bathroom (no word can accurately describe its actually condition).We booked 2 superior room and were given only one superior room with one so called standard room, which is much worse than the superior room. We decided that we should cancel that room and were promised the refund would be in the morning. WELL that never happened. The excuses were the manager wasn't there, and we called later the manager was on vacation. And, we finally get to him to only be confirmed that we will never get our refund back for that one room, whether we like it or not.So, no please do not put yourself, nor your loved ones into this kind of situation as I mistakenly did. Desperate or not, you are better off in your car or in an airport.\",\n",
       " \"Giving this place one star is being optimistic. From the moment I entered the hotel room, I knew my stay was not going to be easy. Upon first inspection, I noticed that the carpet was not vacuumed and the futon was covered in crumbs. Further inspection revealed a lampshade with blood on it, hair on the bedsheets, and a ceiling fan that wobbled so much that leaving it on would be a safety hazard. In the bathroom there wasn't any soap, and the toilet paper roll was almost empty. Also, when the shower was turned on, it would spray all over the bathroom. One of my roommates asked the front desk for more sheets, but they didn't have any. The only sheet she had to sleep on had a huge mysterious black stain on it. Also, there is no parking at this hotel, which is a huge hassle if you are unfamiliar with the city (and don't understand very much French). Needless to say, stay somewhere else. Spend the extra money and book at a higher quality hotel down the street. No one should have to sleep in a hotel room that looks like a CSI crime scene. Sure, this hotel is cheap, but you definitely get what you pay for!\",\n",
       " 'This &quot;Hotel&quot; is probably the most atrocious place I have ever had the misfourtune of visiting, upon arrival there was an employee surfing Porn in plain open view of the public, then we were told we had reserved an &quot;Ecomony Room&quot; in the basement which we knew already but when we entered the room it was crawling with ants and absolutly filthy! when i complained the front desk clerk had to be convimced to move us to another room on the second floor which turned out to be just as bad as the first room ...minus the ants...the room was filthy and stained the shower was full of mold and som chunky substance which I gag when I think of...it was aproximatly 1 am and we didnt know what to do we were told this was the best they had ....after a sleepless night staring at a filthy room we checked out and had to argue to get our money back for the 2nd night which we were made to pay in advance and had no intention of staying the second night the manager was rude and argumentative and really didnt care about us or our situation ! After threatening to call the police we were begrugingly refunded for 1 night , I can honestly say this is the worst of the worst ...no parking and no concern for guests ...Stay away from this place and hopefully they will be forced to clean this place up or do the world a favor and advertise it as it is A DUMP!!!!!!!!!',\n",
       " \"We had initially booked a room at the Hotel Park Avenue for a few nights, through the hotel Website. We had selected the place due to its location - walking distance to our hospital. This was actually an expensive place to stay if you factor the remote parking that the hotel recommended to us (there is no hotel parking!). Staff was cordial but we discovered small and smelly hallways, no elevators and a 'standard room' which we found dirty, smelly, small, old, noisy - poor acoustic insulation; the bathroom especially was the size of a closet and terrible. After sleeping for only 1 or 2 hours during our first night there, we moved on to something better for the other nights. Someone please renovate or tear this place down soon. It is just not worth staying at the Hotel Park Avenue when you can stay at a 4-star hotel a few blocks away for just a few dollars more per night., and get a good night's sleep.\",\n",

What also should have indicated to us that we were not in the right spot was the well dressed foreign business man who came walking down the stairs wth a grin on his face...at 2pm I might add...We got our key, which was an actual key and not a card, and told the guy we wanted to check out the room he gave us first. Well, I think my bedroom at home is bigger and the bed was a super single right next to te entrance of the room...we did not have to look any further, we booked it out of there bfore you could say &quot;pass the salt&quot;!!!We called hotels.com and they were gracious enough to offer to cover the costs the hotel would charge us int he end..thank goodness...I wouldn't even send my worst enemy there!!\",\n",

       " 'I stayed at the Hotel Parc Avenue for a whole month in July 2003 - I was to do a year of studying in Montral preceded by an Intensive French Language course which lasted a month. Unfortunately I booked the university residences too late but was offered this hotel by &quot;La Maison Internationale de Montreal&quot; who deal in accommodation mainly for students.Anyway, to cut to the chase...I found this hotel ideal - especially considering that I only paid about $30 CAD a night! The rooms were a decent size complete with a small refigerator and dish-washing type sink with overhead cupboards, a Combi Cable TV/Radio (bizarre I know!), a lounge type chair, a desk chair and desk and Air Conditioning. The bathroom was basic but clean, towels and face cloths were provided and changed every day.Downstairs on the same floor as reception there is a small but useful kitchen (no pans provided although there were cooking implements), ice machine and outdoor deck.Because of my long stay and because I booked through LAMIMO I had the use of the clothes washing facilities in the basement free of charge, all I had to do was bring my own powder and softner - Laundry could only be done in the evenings though because housekeeping used them during the day for the hotel linen.My only real problem was with the (obviously) antique A/C system - mine leaked all over the floor for some reason despite the temperature being set above the &quot;danger&quot; level for the AC system. I was then moved to another room.... with another AC that proceeded to do the same but not too bad thankfully!Right next to the hotel there is a Dairy Queen and McDonalds, over the road there is a service station with chips and the like but also an A&amp;W. 5 minutes down Mont-Royal one will find a Provigo supermarch, various cafs, an SAQ (Socit des Alcools de Qubec, the chain of government owned liquor stores)15 minutes away one will find the Mont-Royal Metro, however frequent buses for downtown leave from right outside the hotel.If you can put up with a one-star hotel then go for the Hotel Parc Avenue, you basically get what you pay for.

Plenty of TV channels in both French and English. The only problem was the air conditioning. The control is an old dial thermostat which I could deal with but the AC was not cold. I figured it would take a while to cool down but when I laid down to go to sleep I was a bit too warm for comfort. If I had realized earlier that the AC wasn't going to cool the room I would have called the desk to be moved but I was already settled in so I dealt with it.

It's a couple of blocks from the main bus station, and is one block away from the busy Berri-UQAM Metro Station. Furthermore, bustling rue Ste. Catherine with its restaurants and bars is literally around the corner. The location is also close enough to Old Montreal, Centre Ville (downtown) and other main roads for those inclined to drive around town.The service is good. The welcome upon arrival was very pleasant and friendly. The staff was very helpful to me and my friends (who were not hotel guests) when we had to find a taxi one day very early in the morning. Our room, including the bathroom, was kept clean everyday. The free Wifi service in our room was a great bonus too.The only &quot;negative&quot; to this hotel is that it's pretty old - the furniture and wallpaper are dated - it seems that nothing's been changed in more than 25 years. Nevertheless, everything in the hotel seems to be in good working condition, so if aesthetics aren't a big deal to you, then this hotel is fine.For about US$100 a night on Labor Day weekend, this hotel was a reasonably good place to stay. Lord Berri offers no frills, but it covers the basics (clean room, clean bathroom, adequate towels and toiletries, mini-fridge, working AC) pretty well.\",\n",

A couple blocks to the Metro station which took us right to the track. The room was adequate for what we needed - 2 queen beds. Air conditioning worked and so did the fairly new flat screen.Had to ask for more towels - you'd think they would clue in that we may need more than 3 bath towels and 2 wash cloths when I made the reservation and told them how many were in our travelling party.The parking was a little tight.. The rental car fit fine (Dodge Caliber) but I don't think I would have been able to park my truck in the underground parking. There were cameras in the lot and it was gated so I felt fairly confident in the security. Continental breakfast was included but we didn't partake in it, opting for a heartier breakfast at a local sports bar.\",\n",

The staff was extremely friendly, going out of their way to help us. The parking was cheap 15 bucks per night and directly next to the hotel. The room was clean and modern with very new looking furniture and flat screen HD television.. The bathroom wasn't huge but had plenty of space and was comfortable. The metro is a less than one minute walk and St. Catherine st. is right there.

The bed was comfortable and the room was very clean. Not a place for a honeymoon, it's pretty basic but if you want a clean, quiet room within walking distance of nightlife and the festival, it's great. Make sure you bring your confirmation, they didn't have our reservation, we booked through Orbitz. Parking: a lot is attached for $15/day. Will defenitely stay there again.

The bathroom was very unkempt, it was not cleaned very well and the shower was terrible. It frankly smelled like a public washroom. There were no signs of maintenance in that room. The walls were covered in old wallpaper, there were visible cracks and it was dirty. But we dealt with it and at a $100 a night I guess it was expected. The free breakfast was just an afterthought it seemed. Coffee, and stale old, dry pastries and toast. Nothing to sustain a person, possible a Montreal Bagel would be good. One thing that I didn't expect was the door to the room opening on its own not once but three times ! I wonder if any other guests have had this happen to them. We locked the door behind us and on three occasions we heard the door open. I would look and the door was ajar. It was extremely disconcerting. Has anything strange happened to other guests ? I have researched and have not come up with any stories on so called hauntings.All in all you truly get what you pay for. Please don't pay anymore than $100 a night for this hotel/motel.\",\n",
       " \"I've stayed at the Lord Berri 4 times for pleasure and am going back next month. Wouldn't stay anywhere else in Montreal! The rooms and bathrooms are large and clean the beds are great. I would definitely ask for a room on the parking lot side because the street side can be noisy. Staff is friendly and helpful. The restaurant is good, too.The best part of the hotel is the LOCATION. It's 2 blocks from the bus station (where the shuttle from the airport drops you off), one block from the most convenient subway station Berri-UQAM (where 2 or 3 lines cross--very important!), and a block from Sainte Catherine street, one of the most famous streets in the city (for shopping, restaurants, bars, etc.). Right next door is an awesome bookstore (books, music, DVDs) that stays open later than most stores, great for browsing after dinner.\",\n",
       " 'Friendly staff, but located on a grotty busy road in the Latin Quarter.The cosy (small) lobby sadly stunk of frying fat and the place looked rather forlorn. The bedrooms were clean and comfortable and the food edible. Easy access to the Montreal night life. Not the place to enjoy a romantic weekend',\n",
       " \"We stayed at the Lord Berri for 2 nights during Grey Cup weekend in November in Montreal which is one of Canada's biggest sporting event's.Availability to be located in the party central core of hotel's was very difficult,and so called &quot;special event rates&quot; made it expensive.After researching on Tripadvisor at length,asking people,and calling different hotel property's,I felt comfortable with my decision to book with the Lord.We would only be spending our sleeping hour's in the room.The property is located on the outskirt's of the core in my opinion,but taxi fair's very reasonable,or if weather is co-operating and you enjoy a good walk,it would be within reason to wwalk.Old Montreal by taxi was $5cdn tip in.Crescent street,De la montagne street's,nice upper class eatries,and drinking establishment's were under $10cdn tip in.Bell centre for a Montreal Canadien's Hockey game would be around cdn$10.00 tip in.St Catherine street is around the corner.We at no time felt threatned in any way.and we did walk considerable amount.Location to the subway,public transit was very close.The room had 2 Queen size bed's,a TV,small fridge,and the Bathroom was small,but had toiletries,and was clean.The room's are dated,could use some updating,we were in a room facing Rue Berri,I would suggest the other side,even numbered room's I think,because you could hear car traffic at some time's.Park in the Basement if possible,it is a better option I was told!Coffee,and toast were included with our rate which was cdn119.00 per night+17.00 for parking per night.When you compare that to cdn250-300 per night for a better location,but Double the $.We used a taxi and our food and beverage's were bought with the Monie's saved!If you are looking for a place to rest your head after a day of partying or sightseeing and you don't mind a litlle travel.for the dollar's I thought it was reasonable.it ain't the Ritz,but it was clean, close enough to all,the the rate was reasonable.Friendly staff,good in house restaurant for basic meal's,close to the highway to get in and out of Montreal.\",\n",
       " \"We stayed at the Lord Berri for three nights. Good things were its accessibility if you are driving in Montreal for the first time, its underground parking (limited and pricey, but convenient so worth trying to get in), proximity to the Metro station and location near the old port. It also has a decent bar/restaurant and is in a safe area of the city. On the other hand, it didn't impress us overly much, it's a bit anonymous, only one lift goes down to the garage, and it didn't inspire any affection. At about $160 per night for two, it wasn't the greatest value for money.\",\n",
       " 'I truly liked the Lord Berri. How important is the greeting at the front desk? VERY. Veronique greeted me in a very welcoming manner and checked us quickly. She offered the parking garage, and although the price was $7 cheaper next door on the street, I am glad that I took the offer for the parking garage. The garage was clean and a very easy walk to the elevator. Our car seemed much safer in the garage than on the street.We stayed in suite 505. It was really very large: one bedroom, two bathrooms, two closets and a living room. Everything was superior in cleanliness. The furniture was a dark wood. I especially liked the &quot;entertainment center&quot; piece in the living room, and the books on the shelves. One book was the life story of Anne Sexton. Read that story in college.Room included: a safe, a refrigerator, a coffee machine, two air conditioners.Breakfast at the hotel was good. The waiter was very friendly. The restaurant features Italian food, offers a dinner special on mussels ($16.95 ?), and has two wide screens TVs.WIFI access was immediate for $10 for duration of stay. WIFI reception in the room was strong and fast.The maid left lots of supplies and clean towels.University of Quebec at Montreal is directly across the street.Metro stop is a short walk, as is Chinatown and Vieux Montreal.There are a lot of YOUNG beggers / homeless / drug addict kids on St. Catherine Street. Say &quot;desole&quot;, or sorry, and they will live you alone. This hotel appears to be very family friendly. The kids we see in the elevator appear to be happy and enthused with their stay.Nice hotel, great reception at the front desk.',\n",
       " \"I'm not usually one to take the time and write reviews, but this time I had to make an exception. My girlfriend and I decided to plan a weekend trip to Montreal for a bit of shopping, cultural experience, and a to enjoy the night life. Booking under a week to the date, and on a busy summer weekend, as well as not having any experience in Montreal travel, I was quite worried looking for a reasonable place to stay. Browsing through many other hotels, b&amp;b's, and apartments, I was quite nervous of book a place from many mixed reviews. Price was an issue, but we didnt want to go too cheap at the expense of quality. I settled on the Lord Berri because of a majority of good reviews, appealing website and photos, as well as there own underground parking garage. I highly recommend this hotel with the following key pieces of advice.- Get there early on the day of your reservation, even if your room is not ready, so as to secure a spot in their limited underground parking. It's price is similar to independent street level parking lots, but secure and gives you a piece of mind if you're like us and unfamiliar to the safety of areas within the city. - Book online through the hotel website as they often have deals and I managed to score a really nice room with a queen size bed for only $99.Some addititonal good points of this hotel is: - It's two steps off of St. Catherine street where most of the action is. - Ten/ fifteen minutes walk to major shopping/happening spots.- Right beside a Metro stop which by subway can take you anywhere.- A little quieter than staying a few blocks away on the busiest part of town. - I had read mixed reviews about the staff and rooms, however staff was very helpful and provided us with constant directions as well as restaurant ideas. Rooms were also excellent in condition and clean!- Grocery store, drugstore, liquor store, and coffee/book shops, all extremely close for last minute convenience or necessity. Other points:If you're looking for a hotel with other major frills, this might not be the best for you. The lobby is basic and hotel restaurant/bar/cafe was alway empty and quiet. But if you're only there for a short period of time and dont require any special facilities in your hotel, this place is perfect. My recommendation is for the discounted website specials, this hotel has amazing bang for it's buck. If I was going to pay the normal rate at close to 170, I might still choose this hotel, although I'd research around a bit more to see if I could get more for that price. Being as I was looking in the 100 dollars/per range, after all my research and nightmares, this was the best possible outcome I could have hoped for.\",\n",
       " 'Stayed at the hotel for new years eve with college friends, and enjoyed the stay but it was nothing special. The price was good because we traveled with a group that got a good rate, and bus transportation from Boston to Montreal included. The hotel is pretty old, slow elevator, basic bath, average rooms. A nice restuarant located in the main lobby which is great because it has a bar with decent priced drinks for a hotel bar. The serivice was good considering the hotel was full of college students there to party for new years eve. almost the entire hotel was full of students who were there to party, so dont go here on new years for a family trip, i would not recommend it. The hotels location is GREAT and is right in the heart of the city and all the best night clubs and bars. As well as very close to all the historical parts of the city of montreal. I have stayed here the past two new years and am planning on going again for NEW YEARS 2009 at the end of this year, and will stay at the lord berri again. and will enjoy my trip there again.',\n",
       " 'I have stayed at the Lord Berri twice, and I can honestly say that I have no substantive complaints. The hotel is very basic, safe, relatively clean and quiet.However, for what you get, IMO, the price is a bit steep. You can find small hotels and B and Bs not too far away that are far better value. A couple of years ago, this place was a good deal but for the amount they are charging now, I would take my business elsewhere.',\n",
       " \"My friend and I were just at the Lord Berri for a two night stay. It's in a very convenient location (right at the start of the Gay Village, just above ChinaTown, and right next to the Latin Quarter) , and is clean and comfortable. They upgraded us (at no extra charge) to a one-bedroom suite as our requested room type wasn't available upon arrival. It was lovely, with a huge king bed, a sofa bed in the living room, two washrooms, fridge, ironing board/iron. The sofa bed was very uncomfortable (we needed two separate beds so we needed to use the sofa bed) but other than that, it was a perfect spot. The staff was friendly and polite, and with the size of the place (only 10 stories) you don't feel lost in the crowd as you would at a bigger hotel.\",\n",
       " \"Being a smoker, I reserved a Smoking room, but somewhere between me, Travelocity and the Lord Berri, I got a non-Smoking room. Lucky I only had to stay there one night, because the room smelled awful! It smelled like stale sweat only muskier! Next day I was assigned a Smoking room and it had no unpleasant odors at all. In fact I thoroughly enjoyed my remaining four nights in this hotel. Room was comfortable, and quiet even though it was right above a busy street. Staff was pleasant, friendly and very helpful. Had a problem with the tv; they couldn't completely fix the problem but showed me how to manually bypass it to get the tv to work.\",\n",
       " 'I have to say that I have stayed at the hotel 3 times now during the montreal jazz festival. The hotel staff were nice and the rooms were very large. The hotel is a bit old, but for the price it was great. In addition everything was very clean and our window had a great view of the city. I will stay at this hotel again this year in July. The other hotels in the area are either not as close or to expensive. In particular during the jazz festival.',\n",
       " \"We stayed at the hotel while joining some friends who were on a tour from France, so we did not book the hotel ourselves but were part of the tour. When I got the name of the hotel and checked the reviews on Tripadvisor.com, they were so uniformly bad that I almost canceled the trip. All I can is that I'm glad i didn't, as we had a totally different experience. While this is by no means the Ritz , Sheraton, or Hilton, it was perfectly adequate for a night's stay. We came in late independent of our group and the reception was very helpful in finding our reservation and assigned room. The room itself was fine - firm beds and clean, although I would have appreciated an extra blanket - because it was so late I didn't bother calling the desk.\",\n",
       " \"I was employed with a group of people in a temp job for a week, and the employer put us up in this hotel. I didn't know much about the hotel, other than it was in a great location downtown, and had a restaurant attached to it. When I walked into the hotel, I felt like I was in some seedy motel that I would see in these old movies. The decor in the lobby appeared to be from a time before I was born. The desk clerk who checked me in, who was actually pretty friendly, indicated that my hotel room was paid for by my employer. She noted that there was 2 of us staying in the room (myself and another employee that I had yet to meet). She indicated that although the room was paid for, I had to leave a credit card or $500 cash to cover incidentals. The other guest would have to do the same when he/she arrived.I was really reluctant to give my credit card info, given that I was in a foreign city staying at some strange motel - who knows what would happen to my personal and credit card info? Seriously - when you walk into this place, you don't get a sense of poshness or security - one doesn't feel safe - very disconcerting actually. But she indicated the nearest bank machine was quite far away. So despite my serious reservations, eventually I gave in, and gave my credit card info, but made it absolutely clear that it was ONLY to be used to cover incidentals and nothing else. I signed the registration form, and off I went to my room.The room was OK. At least the water was hot. Again, the bedcovers and decor was from the 60s or 70s and the carpet looked like it hadn't been washed in decades. The locks on the door looked flimsy - really only a push button lock that can be jiggered with a credit card. I had to put a chair in front of the door. But I've seen worse. Restaurant food just OK - can walk one block east and one block north to the mall, and get early breakfast for a 1/3 of the price though.Check out time - I make sure I get a receipt - showing the room is paid in full, and that I didn't owe anything because no incidentals were charged. I figured, I'm pretty safe.3 months later, I get a massive charge on my credit card for almost $1000. I call the hotel to get an explanation, and they tell me that the clerk who told me that the room was paid for told me the wrong thing, and that they had the right to charge me because they had my credit card &quot;on file&quot;. They also had the right to charge only me, and not the other guest, because the room was under my name, presumably because I checked in first. Because I had signed the &quot;guest registration card&quot; (which didn't even have any credit card info on it), the credit card company refused to reverse the charge.When a hotel takes your credit card, and tells you that they agree to only hold that information for the purposes of paying for incidentals only, and then months later attempts to make some arbitrary charge on it at their own discretion, without any notice to you, knowing that you're not likely going to be there again to fight it, if you even happen to see it on your credit card bill... well, that's pretty SCUMMY. There is nothing that I can do to control what else they do with my credit card or personal information. The lodging themselves were already quite dodgy, and had I known what the lodgings were like, I would have stayed in a hostel instead. But this practice absolutely apalls me. STAY AWAY! STAY AWAY! STAY AWAY!!! For your own sake.\",\n",
       " \"Well.... I live in montreal and I had to spend one night at this hotel during renovations at my house. First, I want to answer a previous commentary... Even though the bars and others close at 3:00 a.m., it is true that every where else, you can't make noise after 11:00, even if you're at home. It's only a question of respect for other people. There are lots of groups that go there, but also young people studying at the university on the same street, that use this hotel like a residence. Also many people who are waiting for their status concerning immigration. It was not too bad for one night, but I wouldn't have stayed there longer. In our room, we called the reception because we had a question and they answered us awfully, making us feel like .... really disturbing them. The room was really hot even if we were in december ! We even had to use the air-conditioner. It was ok until around 3:00 a.m. This machine started to make an infernal noise and we had to stop it. But the room went hot again immediately, seems like the heating systems was not working well at all. Then at 7:00, the vacuum cleaner began and did not stop for an hour, so we couldn't continue to sleep. Last point but not least... the hotel's restaurant (italian.. Il Cavaliere I think) was horrible, really. It was even really expensive even though it was not good at all.\",\n",
       " \"I went to Montreal with a large group of 16 people. We all stayed at the Lord Berri for 3 nights and all had the same horrible experiance. Firstly, they make you feel as if you are there because of punishment rather than pleasure. The first thing you see on your desk is a list of rules and regulations (some of which are absolutely absurd). Along with fines for damages. Some of the rules include: No walking outside your room in your pajamas, no glass allowed, no eating food outside of the room / bar, doors must be closed at all times, and they keep going.Secondly we had a &quot;security&quot; guard tell us that it was a national law in Quebec that quiet hours start at 11. Yes, he was serious. When do they end? Who knows because he wasn't bright enough to divulge that information. Clearly a lie because clubs on the exact same street as the hotel are open until 3 am. But at the Lord Berri that is an offense for which you can get kicked out.Dumb rules yes, but do they actually enforce them? YES. There is a &quot;security&quot; guard on every floor and their sole purpose is to enforce these rules. You will be constantly invaded by one of these guards, and they will not reason with you. 9 times out of time if you try to reason all you will recieve is: &quot;ITS OVER!&quot; and a stern look. One guard actually tackled someone down in the lobby and gave him a fat lip before he profusely apologized.Bathrooms are clean, which is nice. But if you like hot water you'll be out of luck. When showering there is zero hot water and instead it is ice cold. I had to shower out of the sink with cups because the water was THAT cold. It was this cold for all 3 days, not just one.The TVs look like they were made in 1967 but we had an OK picture. One of the rooms in our group though had one that didn't work and the hotel did nothing.There are cleaning services, but if you are caught leaving a &quot;dirty&quot; room and dont pack up all garbage / used towels you are fined an absurd amount. We kept our room clean though.Lastly, here is the most repulsive issue I have ever seen and we could probably sue them over this. Throughout the trip our toilet would not flush. It was fixed though and apparently all was well.One of our friends come home from our New Year's Eve party around 2 am. They realized they left something in the room, and when they walk in our whole room is flooded because the toilet is pumping water into our room at a constant rate. Quickly they shut the toilet off, and remove the furniture from the room. They being attempting get atleast some of the water out.During this process the &quot;security&quot; guard walks up to them and has the nerve to yell at them for having the door open and a chair outside of the room. He did not want to hear what happened, and my friend finally got through the &quot;IT'S OVER&quot; (x's 100000) and once he realized what had happened maybe you'd expect an apology, or someone to help clean up the mess that their faulty toilet caused...nope not at the Lord Berri.They were left alone to handle it, and were told that someone would come in tomorrow. When all of the parties of that room arrived home to a flooded room / damaged personal property because of the water, surely we could stay in another room.We explained what happened at the desk (in a polite manner), and asked if we could stay in a different room for the night. The man at the desk laughed and said sorry that they could not help us, and said that we needed to speak to a manager who wasn't there but would be there in the morning. So 4 people had to sleep in a toilet water infested room, with no explanation at all. So after 3 hours of sleep Will (one of the 4 in our room) wakes up early (8:30 AM) to speak with the manager. They told us again that he was not there. We checked out later that day with no explanation at all. An apology was in order, but nope it never came. Instead we were rushed out with no apology, no refund, and nothing at all. We did get out 20 dollar security deposit back which is a surprise because when the room flooded my friends were told that we'd be paying thousands of dollars worth of damages. We were a room that obeyed every rule, cleaned up after ourselves, and was always polite even after the room flooded. We have the aftermath of the room on video if this seems like too much to be true.DO NOT STAY AT THE LORD BERRI. If it is your only option delay your trip until another hotel is available.\",\n",

Your lucky if you can get 2 beds.I have stayed in their suites as well : Consisting of a room with a pull out sofa and a tiny bathroom (no shower) the king size bed is in a seperate bedroom and has a slightly larger bathroom with a shower.

For gay visitors, the location is excellent as the gay village is just a few short blocks further down Ste. Catherine. Needless to say, this weekend the hotel was just crawling with sisters!There are very few big hotels in this area, which is a shame - St. Denis is a block away, with its 3-4 blocks of small restaurants and cafes piled on top of each other; a Metro stop is just a couple of blocks away; you can walk anywhere downtown easily from here.The rest is all very 2-star: the rooms are dull but serviceable, and even though we asked for a quiet non-smoking room, it reeked of years of stale smoke and the double windows couldn't block out the street noise (Berri is a busy street, except during festival weekends when it's closed to traffic). Luckily the A/C was working great, as it was very hot and humid. There's a convenient internet kiosk ($1 for 15mins) in the lobby which worked well.Parking was sold out when we arrived, so we parked in a large private outdoor lot right next door ($15/day); the next morning we got an indoor spot (again $15/day, but tiny - only 16 spaces).\",\n",

Happy New Year 2006!!!!!!',\n",
       " \"I stayed at the Lord Berri on a trip from my camp. I do not know how much money was spent per room, but it must have been a very low amount...LOBBY: The lobby of the hotel is very nice for lounging. There is a computer in the corner where you can get 15 minutes of internet access for $1CA, a very good deal compared to what I've seen in most hotels.ROOMS: The rooms were very large and the Air Conditioners were very responsive. You could set your temperature to anything and the air conditioner would work instantly. The TV got some good channels, mostly in french, which was not good for the all-english speaking camp tourgroup. It was interesting however to watch American shows with the French dubbed. You could imagine what they were saying, which was fun. Fridge/Freezer in each room was a nice touch, and unexpected to us.BATHROOM: Nice amenity kit for a budget hotel, including sewing kit, and Pantene Pro-V shampoos, one of the nicest I've seen in any hotel I've stayed at. The showers had good pressure and temperature, however there was a plastic wall that cut into the shower that I did not think was necessary. This was not providing the maximum showering space, which I did not like.BEDS: Very comfortable. I had a very nice sleep in the bed for the two nights I stayed there.DOWNSIDE...only one telephone, located no where near bed, making wake up calls a hassle to answer.LOCATION: A good location to all of the activities we were doing. Parking is adjacent to the hotel which provided a conveinent spot for the cars. Within walking distance from Old Montreal, which is a place to definitely check out. OVERALL: I only saw people in groups at the hotel, and I think the hotel does a good job at catering to groups. If you do not like a lot of children around the floors, Hotel Lord Berri is DEFINITELY the wrong hotel. If you don't mind children, and not having a pool or fitness center, Hotel Lord Berri is a great hotel.\",\n",

Every time we called the front desk to ask for directions or help on where to go for food or entertainment, they didn't have a clue about anything and was like pulling teeth to get them to help. When we asked if they had a vending machine the guy at the front desk told us that no they don't have one and what do we expect for a 3 star hotel! That's actually what he said! We witnessed the girl at the front desk tell someone that there is a $50.00 fee if you check out late and she actually hung up on the person she was telling this to. So if you stay there don't check out late! Also, we arrived at 3:40 in the afternoon. Check in time is 3:00. Our room was not ready yet and we were told it would be another 30 minutes! Room should have been ready at 3:00!! The room itself was OK, A bit outdated. Not the nicest, and definitely NOT worth the $149.00 we were quoted on the phone when we called. We ended up with a last minute deal for $93.00 but I'd say this room was worth maybe $79.00. The girl at the desk told us we had an adjoining room and we ended up with two rooms down completely different hallways. When we asked about this she told us that she didn't know what adjoining meant. We had a couple of problems with maids telling us they had written down on their sheet that we were checking out that day when we weren't so we had to go clear that up with the front desk. And they never did bother to come and give us clean towels or make our beds on our second day. We had to find a maid in the hallway and ask her to come and do that at 5:00 in the evening. The day we arrived our bath tub had hairs all over it. So they clearly don't clean that in between customers. And the &quot;indoor&quot; parking has about 10 spots (for $16.00 a day). Good luck getting in and out of that parking garage. We were charged $1.15 for each LOCAL call we made. Usually that is free. We had two rooms and the phone in the other room wasn't working properly. On a positive note, the guy who ran the bar in the restaurant was friendly and far more helpful with directions than the front desk and the young guy who worked in the smoke shop was friendly also and helped us with directions. They should be at the front desk.\",\n",
       " 'I stayed for a night at this hotel and since I came late I requested an extension of the time of the checkout and my request was very nicely accepted. My room was very clean and the staff were very professional and very nice even guiding me through maps over the major outlets in the city and I would highly recommend it for anyone who is in a business trip in downtown or for leisure.',\n",
       " \"We booked 2 nights in Montreal at the Hotel Lord Berri about a month in advance of our trip. We booked through hotels and on the web site concerning the Hotel Lord Berri it stated &quot;indoor parking (free)&quot;. Well when we got there, the desk clerk told us there was no indoor parking and we had to park outside and pay $13 a day. Upon leaving the hotel we discovered there was indoor parking and asked to speak to the manager about it, since our two night stay turned into a three night stay due to damage while we were parked in the parking lot outside. He was not in and two desk clerks were very helpful with our concerns and issues. However, the first employee we talked to was beyond the point rude. She was not helpful at all and infact insulted us instead. We were told the manager would call us in a day and discuss our concerns with the parking and his employees. He did not call and when we finally called in a couple days later, while we were still on vacation, he made it clear he purposely did not call us and would not help us. After a long chat he said he would call us back in a week after talking to his employees. Well he didn't and when we did again he began yelling and simply hung up on us. The hotel obviously is not concerned with the satisfaction of their customers and I would never reconmmend that hotel to even my worst enemy.\",\n",
       " \"The hotel was clean. Staff friendly. Restaurant served a good breakfast. One block from Berri subway station. 2 blocks from Quarter Latin. Quiet area. I couldn't ask for a better hotel for $80.00/night. My friends and I are going back next year and we will again stay here.\",\n",
       " \"A decent place to stay for a weekend getaway. Facility is clean and close enough to St. Catherine's Street. The rooms are comfortable. The price is fair. I stayed at this hotel 2 years ago and I am actually booking another trip to Montreal next month and this is where I plan on staying.\",\n",
       " \"For the price $120 a night its complete rip off. Its is not 3 star hotel AT ALL. I booked 3 weeks in advance asking for non-smoking and guess what...got smoking room. Its an old hotel therefore the floors are smelly. Rooms have tiny windows looking across the other hotel. At the front desk young guys are on minimum wages so dont expect any professionalism. I asked for iron in the morning, wow! they did not know it was broken, it was 100 year old iron. The people in the hotel are all groups. This hotel sells rooms at discounted prices for probably $30 to a groups so buses all over. If you don't want to spoil you trip in Montreal, don't stay there. We only could stay one night and moved out to Fabourge hotel closer to downtown. Its a 2 star but what a difference!!!! for SAME PRICE!!! New hotel, just a year build. Breakfast included, valet parking, professional staff, beautifull!!! Recommended very much.\",\n",

But DO NOT make the mistake we did last December. On New Years Eve, HUNDREDS of college kids and high school kids checked in and ran riot throughout the hotel. They set off the fire alarm SIX TIMES starting at 1am. The hotel management did NOTHING about it. The drunken kids ran through the hallways laughing and screaming, slamming doors and stomping up and down the stairwells to visit their friends on other floors. This went on ALL NIGHT LONG. There were fights in the hallways and, the next morning, there was trash scattered throughout the hotel. Other than that, we had a nice stay.\",\n",

After brief discussion the front desk kindly agreed to waive that charge and we agreed to pay a one-time fee of $30 for the room change.I am grateful to the hotel for this flexibility.

       " \"Location- within walking distance to many places (Notre Dame and other bascilicas, Chinatown, Old Montreal, Latin Quarter)Room- A whole lot larger than we expected. It really was previously apartments, so the main bedroom can be an office with a pull out bed/converted couch w/ a tv and free internet access, and the main living room space is where the main bed(s) are. The kitchenette was very convenient. We didn't feel like we were in a hotel room, more like an apartment which was comforting and spacious.Breakfast- Comes with the room rate. Cereal bar, (ok) coffee, juices, several types of breads, oatmeal, yogurt, eggs, pre-made omelletes, sausage, and bacon. Better than a continental breakfast and can hold you over till lunch. This Holiday Inn Express, not the Sofitel.Parking- We came in through train from Quebec City, so didn't need any parkingStaff- Most of the people at the reservations desk were in their 20's, younger than expected. But they were accomodating and got the job done.All in all the hotel was clean, well kept, breakfast was expected, the room def. felt like we got value for our money. We spent 3 nts. in Oct at $101/nt.\",\n",
       " 'My family (myself, wife, 4 year old, and 2 year old) stayed three nights. It was a pleasant stay. The room was casual in decor, spacious and clean. The price was very good as Montreal had a city wide special called the Summer Sweet Deal with the third night 1/2 off. The breakfast was decent although it got extremely crowded. The location was very good - right next to Chinatown where you could get some cheap eats at the numerous Vietnamese restaurants. The hotel was also in easy walking distance from the old town. The valet parking was pretty convenient as they retrieved the car quickly. The only real issue that we had was that one could not reserve a crib ahaed of time as they were available only first come first serve. That policy is a bit wrong headed as visitors need to know for certain if they can get a crib (we brought our own).',\n",
       " \"Our family stayed for the Thanksgiving/Columbus Day long weekend and was very pleased with this hotel...Great location just a few minutes walk from the Old Port and St. Catherines Street. There is an $18.00 per day parking fee but that includes valet and in/out priveleges so it's very convenient and not unreasonable for downtown parking.  The rooms were large and perfect for a family. As well as the standard bedroom portion there is also a kitchenette (full size fridge, microwave, sink, but no stove) with a counter and a couple of stools. Plus there's a second bedroom (!) with pull-out sofa and 2nd TV. Breakfast is included but it's hit &amp; miss. The cold portion includes cereals, yogurt, various breads &amp; spreads, juice machine, coffee and a bowl of bananas. Perfectly adequate. The hot portion is sort of gross and includes egss &amp; meat, changed each day. The scrambled eggs tasted strange, perhaps powdered, so I didn't try.the fold-over omelettes the next day. Bacon was very thin and greasy so I didn't try the pork patties the next day either. All served buffet style with disposable plates, cups &amp; cutlery. Unfortunately no pool. Room rate averaged out to around $110 per night which is very reasonable when you consider the location, size of room and breakfast for the four of us. If I return to Montreal I think I'd scout out a hotel with a pool first. But unless it was around the same price, I'd came back to the Holiday Inn again. I'd rather spend my money on the excellent restaurants in Montreal!\",\n",
       " \"We only had one day to stay in Montreal after our cruise with Holland America. We stayed here due to the proximity to Chinatown, Notre Dame Catherdral, and Rue St. Pierre. The room was decent (two queen beds), and we were fortunate to get early check in (arrived around 10 and the room was still being cleaned up, but the maid was nice enough to let us drop off our stuff). Chinatown is relatively small compared to other metro cities, but they have some pretty good bakeries. The T-stop (subway) is right across the street, so really handy to get to the RESO (underground mall). And Notre Dame and Rue St. Pierre is a five minute walk.If you're looking for a clean, decent room, this will suffice. It wasn't fancy or luxurious, but for our purposes, it was fine. We took the Gray Line tour recommended by the concierge, and it was worth it (they picked &amp; dropped off to our hotel). The price for the room was decent, too. Free internet was a plus.\",\n",
       " \"I liked the hotel. It was clean, they gave us a nice big suite and the breakfast was good. Valet parking is ~$19 (Can.) and there isn't really a good multi day public parking nearby. Hotel location is excellent if you want to visit the old part of the city and chinatown.\",\n",

The room had a an attached kitchen and a study with Wired internet connectivity.The location is perfect for those who would like to visit the old montreal city as it very much walkable from the hotel. Only if they dont charge the fee for parking.',\n",
       " \"We arrived in mid-afternoon on August 21 2009. I had called to verify my reservation the previous Wednesday; all was as it was reserved. We took the train to Montreal and walked to our hotel which was convenient. They checked us in quickly as we arrived on our floor we noticed how dingy and dark the hallways were; it was in need of some immediate TLC, as soon as we entered the room we were in a smokey and smelly room, which boasted terrible decor and a smelly couch. The flooring was terribly dirty. We are non-smokers and my daughter and I are severely sensitive to smoke; therefore we had reserved a non-smoking room with two queen beds. This was nothing like what we had reserved. When we called down from the room, we were told that's all that they had and they would speak to the manager. After several minutes, I started to feel ill and we went back downstairs where we were treated like third rate citizens. They had us speak to a man which they claimed was the manager, who refused to make changes and refused to check us out. So I gave them their keys back and myself, my husband and my small children walked out with them watching, knowing fully that we had come on foot and that there were no hotels with rooms avaiblable that weekend. We walked to a nearby hotel who released a room for us (DAYS INN on Rene Levesque, just a block down the road). When I called the following day (as the reservastion was for two nights) they did not want to put me through to a manager and they claimed not to be able to check me out early as it was pre-paid. We paid $350 for the two nights. We have travelled throughout Canada, USA, UK and the Caribbean, we have stayed at various types of accommodations, we have never NEVER been treated like this. TERRIBLE HOTEL STAFF!! TERRIBLE ROOM!! and NO REGARD FOR FAMILIES we had to change our train reservation to return home the following day as there were no hotels available in the downtown core, needless to say my children were sadened and we were completely confused as to why in this day and age we would be treated this way. I delayed writing this review because I tried to contact them to see if they could explain, apologize and refund our money; ALL of which they did NOT do.\",\n",
       " 'The hotel was beautiful inside and the rooms were spacious. Our room had a fully size refrigerator and sink, and a queen size bed. The sheets were extremely soft and the pillows were firm. I really would recommend this hotel. You will need to pay for parking and that costs $18. This hotel is only blocks away from near Vieux-Port and is within reasonable walking distance to Rue-St. Catherine (about 2 blocks) where you have your chain restaurants and clothing stores, the underground city (with lots of stores to shop) and the train station, Saint Laurent. The supermarket is 1 block away. You can also walk to Musee de Chateau Ramezay, Marche Bonsecurs, Place Jacques Cartier, Basilique de Notre Dame Montreal, and take a cruise along the St. Lawrence River. (We used La Ba Bateau Mouche.) You can take the train to Champ de Mars to visit these sites, but if you stay at the hotel you can walk a few blocks. (like 5 blocks) This hotel is in an excellent location as it in downtown Montreal. This hotel may also come up in your search as Holiday Inn Express Montreal Centre-ville Downtown, is located at 155 Rene-Levesque East, Montreal, Quebec H2X3Z8. The hotel has free internet. It has a great FREE breakfast (eggs, cheese, sausage, cereal, bacon, yogurt, toast etc.)',\n",
       " \"Booked room via PriceLine, good rate. Hotel was obviously under renovation, our floor was under construction, room was 'well used'. I log more than 60 room nights a year and this was the worst in a long time - by far.\",\n",
       " 'Great location, just steps from the Old Montreal and all attractions. Spacious rooms, quite for downtown location. Breakfast typical for Holiday Inn. Only one disadvantage - just 2 elevators, and one was not in use. We had to use the stairs (lucky to stay on the 5th floor).',\n",
       " \"My daughter and I stayed in this hotel in early July 2009. Our room was a suitewith a bedroom (with a door) and a living room with a pull-out sofa. There wasa TV in the bedroom and living room. There was a microwave, full-size refrigerator, sink, dishware, and silverware. There is a breakfast buffet, and it is the same as the buffets I've encounteredat other Holiday Inn Express locations. There is an egg dish daily (omeletsor scrambled eggs), with meat (sausage or bacon), along with their famouscinnamon rolls, toast, muffins, cereal, juices, tea, and coffee. It's a prettybusy place as of around 7:45am or so. The hotel has an elevator. We did not have a vehicle, so I cannot comment regarding parking. There was Internet access available, but in our room it was only available withan Ethernet cable. That was acceptable for me. I understand that there was wireless available in the lobby. I have read other comments regarding the questionable surroundings. I did not have that same feeling. We were one block from Chinatown. Granted, on your way to the Metro station you do pass some strip clubs, but in the daytime there'snot much going on there. We were only a couple of blocks away from a large IGA store, and we found thatwe could get food items there and prepare them in our rooms. That store connectsinto the large underground mall. I wanted to mention that when we arrived at the train station, I inquired of one of the cab drivers about the hotel location. (I was wanting to take a cabto the hotel). The cab driver, obviously not wanting to deal with a small fare,said it was only &quot;2 blocks away&quot;. In reality, it took us almost 30 minutes to walk there down Rene Levesque Boulevard, pulling luggage the whole time. I would highly recommend this hotel to anyone visiting Montreal. It is at a good location, and the price was quite reasonable.\",\n",
       " \"I've been staying at this hotel on a regular basis all summer on business (usually Sundays thru Friday mornings, but several weeknds as well) &amp; I would recommend this hotel to almost anyone. Is it perfect? Of course not. As noted in other reviews, the internet service is terribly slow &amp; not even wireless (but at least you get internet service- I've stayed at hotels with &quot;free high-speed wireless&quot; that barely worked, if at all) &amp; the floor hallways seem somehow barren. However, I firmly believe the good points of this location far exceed the few deficiencies.- All rooms are suites &amp; they are a fair size (as alreadyu noted, they are converted condos).- Rooms are very clean &amp; kept clean during your stay.- Beds are comfortable, but the bed &amp; bath linens are high-quality- very comfortable.- Location-wise for tourists, it cannot be beat. You are in the heart of Montreal... literally a minute &amp; a half to the corner of Ste.Catherine &amp; St. Laurent, ditto Chinatown. A ten minute walk to the heart of Old Montreal &amp;, during &quot;festival season&quot; you are one to seven minutes away from a festival- Just for Laughs, Mntrl.Intl.JazzFest, Franco-Folies... you name it... all summer long something for everyone.- Walk-in rates.... I had friends from home driving through Mntrl. &amp; they spontaneously decided to stay the night &amp; enjoy the beautiful city with me for an evening. They got a rate of something just under CAN$120... this is fantastic given location &amp; all the other pluses this hotel has to offfer.- Although I can't think of his name (very embarrasing), the who-I-assume-to-be-senior valet parking gentleman was tops- always with a friendly smile, a funny little story &amp; a willingness to help you out in a flash. The rest of the staff are also just fine, but this fellow was a wonder- definitely worth mentioning him in the plus section!Can't really say more than I &amp; other posters have said already (including a decent free breakfast with hot items), except I urge you to consider this place of you are visiting as a tourist- convenient location alone makes this well-priced hotel an outstanding choice!\",\n",

       " \"I went with my other half for our second year of attendance at the Just for Laughs Comedy Festival.First let me start by saying we took VIA in from downtown Guelph, to downtown Montreal via Toronto. I really do recommend VIA, even if they decided to talk about strike action the night we arrive (the Monday), and actually strike at 12 noon on the day we were to leave (the Friday). Haha, we were lucky as VIA was able to get us on the 630am train (ugh) which got us to an empty Union Station in Toronto at 11:30 am, a half hour before the strike took affect. But, once again, when VIA has everything operating, it is such a great way to go from dt to dt, no gettting to the airport, no security checks to have to wait at, and in VIA1 business the service is quite excellent , with full bar service and meal / snacks at a great price. Anyone want more infor about VIA1 (Business Class) in the Southwestern to Montreal corridor, just ask, i've done it a few times.Ok, back to the hotel in question. I am writing this review not only as a visitor to Montreal, but also as a loyalist to the ICHotels Group of hotels (whose brands include Crowne Plaza, Holiday Inn, Holiday Inn Express, Intercontinental, and others). If you read my previous posts I really try to overlook what others have said and usually find the best of each hotel. We arrive around 5pm into Montreal and make the short walk, about 10 minutes, from Gare Centrale to the hotel. Check in, and the man at the counter is very nice. Get to the room and 'give me a break'...if you could possibly lay down the floor plan and pick the worst room, I got it. The hotel has an inner courtyard (open to the outside) but non the less a courtyard on three of the back walls. So, I get the inner corner room, looking into a dark space, with a window of my neighbour to my right at 90 degrees and of course the window across the courtyard. It only ticks me off, because, if I owned a hotel, this would be the last room I'd give away. This is the type of room they give to someone who got a way tooo good deal on hotwire, not the room you give someone who is a Platinum Priority Club member or anyone who paid website rate on the IChotels.com website, especially if the hotel still has other rooms available. But that being said, I called down and asked for an exterior facing room and they moved me no problem. But, once again, why would you do this in the first place.The first room and the replacement room, both different layouts, but both have small kitchen areas, which I've never had in any hotel room before....this actually came in quite handy. Now, let's focus on the 'replacement room'. None of the rooms have a safe, but that wasn't a problem, nothing went missing even with 2 laptops sitting out. The bed and bedding were the standard very good quality HIE (Holiday Inn Express) style, as were the towels. The room , as others have stated, is a converted condo, so you have your kitchen facing what should be the living area, which is where they put the beds and then the bedroom is used for the sofa and desk and the second tv. Why this layout you ask? Well, when we pondered this, it's clear that in order to comfortably accommodate the 2 queen beds, this was the only option. The furnishings are standard, simple yet solid, but not cheap looking, HIE type furnishings. Internet is wired, 'high speed', but , as stated earlier, is quite slow. I'd highly reccommend disabling your pictures in your browser settings to help speed this up. But, once again, it is free, so that is nice.The hotel is very convenient to St. Denis Theatre (where alot of the Just for Laughs shows take place), and St. Denis is like a really long Queen West in Toronto with a big mix of both unique and commercial stores as well as a gazillion eating establishments , alot with patios. So conveniently located that this hotel wins as far as location goes.. Sketchier as you walk east and north from this hotel, but still not anything to be afraid of, even at night. And China town and the downtown shopping area as well as the magnificent Old Montreal are so easy to walk to. The morning breakfast bar, included in the HIE price, was a mad house....but well stocked with attendants always keeping the items full. The first day was the usual , cereal, yogurt, milk, juices and the HIE cinnamon rolls and assorted breads. On the rotation; day 1 was an omellete with or without cheez whiz and sausage patties. On day 2 was scrammbled eggs and bacon. With it being so busy, thank goodness for the hotel not being that big, so I was able to grab a plate and take it back to the room. Oh, on that note, the elevators are slow during peak tyimes, so if you can, take the stairs.There are laundry machines in the back hall as well as a small tuck shop. The concierge desk seemed to always be covered when we would pass through the lobby. Well I did book this based on brand, price and location....but if there is a good price at the HI Mid Town I would probably go that route, as I stayed there before and it was good, but pricey.\",\n",

Very quiet even though we were across from the elevators and overlooked the fairly busy street (good insulation). Easy walking distance to many restaurants, 2 blocks to Chinatown. Breakfast is included and normal for Holiday Inn Express, which is good: hot dish (eggs, etc.), cinnamon rolls, fruit, bagels, bread, cereal, juices, etc. The staff was helpful.

So the rate was pretty good.2 )The room decor was dated but it was very clean and the room was a good size (1 queen), breakfast in the morning was good for your basic hot buffet.Bad Things:1) The internet was useless it was slower then dialup. I used my PDA instead thankfully it was just to lookup some addresses.2) We requested a crib when booking the room, then asked again when we checked in at 1pm, when we got back from dinner the crib still wasn't in the room so we called the front desk and asked where it was. They said they would send it right up. About an hour later they called back and said they had no cribs available. They didn't offer any alternatives and just asked if there was anything else. Not impressed. The next morning we complained and the manager just said, &quot;cribs are not guaranteed, it's first come first served&quot;. I argued that we asked while checking in and were told it would be no problem to get a crib, otherwise we would have request 2 beds or cancelled and gone somewhere else since the two of us got no sleep as we were afraid of rolling onto our son. She just kept saying it's not guaranteed. We ended up with a 20% discount. I would have rather slept.\",\n",

The room was pretty and very comfortable.

       " 'While this Holiday Inn has a good location and good service at a reasonable price, there were way too many negatives for a business traveller.Upon entry of my first room, the bathroom had a sickening fecal smell. Over the two nights I spent in this room, this smell did go away. I selected this hotel based on its offer and availability of high speed internet. On this, it failed to deliver. In my first room, it cease to work after an hour of use. I spent almost 3 hours with tech support, switched cables three times, before we determined that the problem was with the wall connection. I was offered a switch of rooms which I accepted. I received no assistance in moving. To my relief, this room did not have the same fecal smell. As before, the Internet lived up to its promise for a couple of hours and then was abysmally slow foe the remainder of my stay. I gave up trying to resolve as I did not want to spend hours on the phone again with tech support.This location can use another elevator - there are only two in operation, so wait times can be slightly aggravating. Further, the corridors are run down and you feel institutional.On a positive note, staff service was excellent and attentive.',\n",
       " 'We returned to this hotel while visiting family in Montreal, after having a pleasant stay last fall. They informed us at checkin that due to renovations our reserved non smoking room was not available and we were being given a 2 bedroom smoking suite that they had aired out for us. The suite was on the second floor, which is apparently not often used by guests. The housekeeping storage area is there, and when we got off the elevator (at around 7 PM) we were met with a number of randomly abandoned housekeeping carts in the lobby area, and filthy carpets. Our suite was large and comfortable though, so we stayed. At our request, the carts were stored away (as they should have been originally). The next morning, we were woken at 7:30 by loud voices outside our room. A quick peek showed that the entire housekeeping staff was standing outside our room, loudly chatting before starting their day. I informed them that there were guests on the floor, and they quieted down. But - they never cleaned our suite, and we returned that evening to unmade beds, no towels, etc. Things were quieter the next morning, but on Saturday we were again treated to the loud morning chatting, waking us early. Additionally, this suite has strange sounds, that the management is aware of. There are scraping metallic noises, and banging noises on and off throughout the night. On the plus side, the desk staff is friendly and helpful, and tried to help us as we went from one negative experience to the next. But nothing quite compensates for walking out of the elevator each time onto a repulsively filthy carpet and then being woken by inconsiderate loud staff 2 of our 4 mornings.',\n",

Negatives:- I'm not sure if this is Hotwire or the hotel but we were placed on a smoking floor and told that there were no other rooms available. Our room faced Rene Leveque St. so opening the window at night made it hard to sleep. We woke up with sore throats after the first night. It wasn't so bad the second night.- Breakfast buffet. Even though it was included in the price we opted to eat out (Eggspectations in Old Montreal - very good) on our second morning because the quality was terrible. Cardboard bacon, tasteless and weird-textured eggs, terrible coffee. So, aside from the breakfast and the smoking floor room - this hotel is in a great location with very friendly staff and the rooms are very spacious.\",\n",
       " \"Booked 2 rooms for 2 nights under the Sweet Deals package, which gives you 50% off the second night - a great bargain! The hotel has a pretty decent location in downtown Montreal, not far from the seedy Rue Ste Catherine, and right across the street from Chinatown. Only a couple of blocks away is Vieux Montreal, the old port which is really neat and full of great shops and restaurants right along the St. Lawrence and the quais. The rooms were very roomy, the beds were large and comfortable. Plenty of TV stations, in both French and English. The bathroom was neat, roomy, and came with the usual amenities. Also had a kitchen in both rooms, which we didn't really use much. Only complaints were the water heater in our one room didn't work one morning and they had to use the other bathroom to shower. Also, the A/C system was not up to par, it was a window-mounted unit, that was supposedly controlled by a wall-mount thermostat...well whatever, between the 5 of us, all fairly intelligent people, we could not get either room's climate control system to work. Luckily the windows opened, but that got a bit brisk overnight and into the next morning. Breakfast was alright; HOWEVER, I advise against going later on a weekend day. We got there around 8:30 on Saturday morning, and it was getting full. On Sunday, we didn't get there til 9:15am, and the seating area was completely full, with many families and obnoxious kids, with a long line out into the lobby, and people pushing and being generally rude to each other. I said to hell with it, and just found a Tim Horton's, conveniently located not far down Rene Levesque.All in all, I recommend the HI Express Downtown, but be careful on weekends, at it's usually packed, especially from May on with the weather being warmer. Plenty to see and do in the city, take the hike up Mont Royal, awesome view! Also, while most natives/locals have a working knowledge of English, most of the signs and literature is in French, and can be a pain to translate if you don't know a bit of French. Just not very user-friendly, and very ethnocentric, when you consider how hard Quebec pushes for tourists to come and check out their province, especially Americans.\",\n",
       " 'We went to this hotel for the price and location you are a 5 to 10 dollars taxi ride into the downtown and about half hour walk down to the Bell Center or to the shopping district area .The front service counter very helpful and fast The hallways seem to be run down not bright enough The rooms very big two double size beds and one room set to the side with a desk and a office table with a pull out bed with a tv .it does have a kitchen with microwave the rooms are really clean the beds are soft .The breakfest area is small will be pack by 930 so get there early the breakfest is alright eggs bacon cinmon buns cercels orange juice they do provide a morning newspaper at the front desk area .',\n",
       " \"We didn't find this hotel noisy, staying over a weekend out of season or as shabby as other reviews had suggested. Admittedly , the carpets in the corridors are stained in a few places and the public areas could do with smartening up. However, our bedrooms were clean and well appointed with small kitchens ,a sitting room and reasonable sized bathroom( bath products were ok but not plentiful, just shampoo and bath gel). Breakfasts were standard Holiday Inn Express fare but adequate. Location is on the doorstep of a small Chinatown with about 10 minutes walk or less to Old Montreal and generally well placed for sightseeing.\",\n",
       " 'This hotel looked like it was converted from a former condo building because the rooms were very large and spacious. The daily breakfast was up to standard and housekeeping did a fine job. To get to the closest Metro stop, one had to go through a somewhat run-down part of town. The second closest Metro stop is much farther away through Chinatown.My only beef with this hotel is that when I checked out, I was forced to pay a ridiculous extra fee of some sort by clueless front desk staff. Thanfully this was promptly and courteously reversed after I complained to the hotel manager upon return home.',\n",
       " \"Stayed for a weekend with some friends to have fun in Montreal...found it for a great price on Priceline and ended up in a one bedroom suite with pull out couch in the living room area and kitchen for $50.00 a night!The room was in pretty good shape (except for some beat up corners of coffee tables and some edges of the walls, but I really can't complain). The beds were comfortable, the bathroom was very clean and had enough tolietries and towels, and the kitchen had a mircowave, full sized fridge, dishwasher and a set of dinner plates/cups/bowls, etc...Staff were friendly, promptly offered us umbrella's when they saw we didn't have one for a sudden rainstorm. Gave us suggestions on where to eat and called cabs for us whenever we wanted to go out.The location wasn't RIGHT downtown, but it worked. The hotel is near China Town and not too far from Rue St. Catherine. Would def go back :)\",\n",
       " \"Booked through hotwire and when we got to the hotel they told us we were booked into a smoking room. I asked why and they said hotwire had booked a smoking room. I asked to change to a non-smoking and they said yes they could change, but for $30. We couldn't convince them otherwise, and were even told that transferring from a smoking room to a non-smoking room is &quot;considered an upgrade,&quot; and that this was hotel policy. The hotel room was not only extremely dingy and run down, it smelled stuffy and strongly of smoke. I have used hotwire many times and had never had any trouble before so I looked up their terms of use and it specifically says that hotwire books non-smoking rooms and that room is assigned at check in. My husband and I are extremely unhappy with this experience. On top of it all, the room was noisy; we could hear people walking above our floor and also people going up and down the stair well all night. We did not sleep. Safe to say that this was my worst hotel experience ever.\",\n",
       " \"Standard Holiday Inn Express...which is great, as I seek these out when I can for their value and excellent free breakfast. This one is in a good location in Montreal, on a main thoroughfare, and not far from the Metro. We were able to walk most places we wanted to go, but used the Metro so as not to exhaust ourselves. Our room was a queen suite, two rooms with a kitchenette. High speed internet was wired, but free. The TV had extensive channels included in both French and English. Amenities included were shampoo, soap, and bath gel, which was nice. The shower head was low, even I, at 5'8&quot; needed to duck a bit to get under it. The clock radio had a dual alarm, which was a nice touch. The kitchenette featured a full size refrigerator, microwave, and electric coffee pot, as well as plenty of cabinet space. As ours was just a two night stay, we did not get to use it.The complementary breakfast was wonderful. This one had hot entrees, the first day scrambled eggs and bacon, the next had cheese omelets and sausage patties. The attendants had trouble keeping the food stocked as demand was high. I had planned to have one of the world-class cinnamon rolls on my last morning there; alas, they ran out and were not restocked before I had to leave. Coffee is available all day long here.Parking is by Valet and is an additional charge. Cars are stored in an underground garage. You will want to take advantage of this as we did see an unfortunate car owner nearby whose car had been broken into by shattering the window. An odd thing did happen...the Valet rung our room with a cryptic message, stating something &quot;perhaps comical&quot; had occurred, without revealing details on the phone. We ran down immediately to check out the issue, seems he had knocked a cup of coffee we left in the car cupholder...but as far as we could tell, nothing spilled on the car, somehow the entire thing spilled into his pocket. We were grateful for his &quot;head's up&quot;, but would have appreciated more detail about this inconsequential event on the phone, as he inspired great worry on our part. Nonetheless, kind, and he did not have to alert us at all.Chinatown is just two blocks away, and we were within an easy walk of Old Montreal. We took advantage of the outdoor ice skating rink there, which was fantastic. The rink is well used, but it seems the ice is groomed about every 1.5--2 hours. With music playing, it was lovely. We were within easy walk of the downtown shopping, but you may want to hop onto the Metro for a top or three to save your legs. We atteded the Titanic Exhibition at the Eaton Center and highly recommend this well-done, moving presentation.We're planning a return trip for the summer and will not hesitate to stay here again!\",\n",
       " \"Booked two jr suites, expecting each to be one large room with separate sitting areas, but they were actually two separate rooms WITH BALCONYS! great view... Breakfast was typical Holiday Inn Express fare... lots to choose from and good quality... my little sister still talks about their cranberry juice (i don't like cranberry juice, so i can't offer an opinion, but she insists it's great). only complaint was no pool, but the hotel was made for business people, who probably don't use it anyway...\",\n",
       " \"There were a few good things about this hotel - the people who worked there were very nice, the rooms were large, and it is centrally located between Old Montreal, Rue Saint Denis, and Mont Royal. Even though it was freezing we walked most everywhere, though the Metro is very close. Now the bad part: the place was swarmed by groups of tough looking college-age kids on tour buses - how many, it is hard to venture a guess, but I'll estimate at least 200. I'm young too, and I like to have fun as much as the next person, but this hotel was the very definition of a ZOO. I swear I'm not a wuss, and really want others to have fun, but it was out of controlThey asked the people coming in, who were coming to party at the hotel to sign a waiver for damage (in their rooms because there is no bar) and NOT to party in their rooms. Instead, they said they could be in the lobby, outside the hotel etc. When you got off the elevator during any time over 2-3 days, there were dozens of drunken idiots milling about, or when waiting to check out, sitting on their bags so that no one could even attempt to get by them. Then try to get out the door through drinking, smoking swarms. NO ONE at the hotel asked these people to move, get out of the way etc. It was ridiculous. There was so much pot smoke in the hallways (even though I was on a non smoking floor) that is was like being in the movie &quot;Up in Smoke&quot;. Then they were banging on the doors screaming &quot;826&quot; for the room the big party was in. No one at the hotel really cared, even though these folks put signs up as early as 11AM for the allday/allnight party.At about 4:30 AM, the fire alarms went off, over and over again. No announcement, no explanation at all. Just kept ringing on and on in the hallways and rooms, and five firetrucks outside. It was piercing not to mention infuriating, and we were exhausted the next day. I kind of feel bad venting but I just can't believe the people running the place had such little disregard for the many other people staying there. The hallways are foul - the rugs are filthy and stained - ugh.The rooms were good, but for the experience, wayyyy overpriced.\",\n",
       " 'Booked through Priceline for 60$US all inclusive. The hotel is well situated, close to Berri-UQAM and Place des Arts stations, the underground city, the Quartier Latin an Chinatown. Street parking is free on Saturday (from 6PM) up to Sunday 1PM, so take advantage of this, if you are there on the weekend. The hotel itself is simple and effective, check in was easy (arrived early but still was accommodated). The room is huge, studio style, with a queen bed, a full size kitchen, minus stove (there is a microwave), and a good work station, with free internet connection. The bed itself was a tad too hard to my liking, but I could spend a week there. Note that the IGA at Complexe Desjardins is 3 blocks away, so it is possible to do your groceries there. Bathroom was standard, with a rather anemic shower. But all was clean and in good shape. Carpet has seen better days.As with all HI Express, breakfast is included, with bland powdered scrambled eggs, bacon (good), the infamous HIE cinnamon rolls (OK at best), yogurts, toast, frozen waffles, fruits, OJ, and decent coffee. They provide you with a take out bag if you want to eat in your room. The gym was small and spartan, with second had equipment, but functional. Overall, I recommend this place if you are on an extended stay with no car (valet parking is 17$CAN per day). Overall, very pleased with my stay.',\n",

       " \"As soon as we got up to our floor, we noticed dirty bedding piled sporadically along the hallway (this was a normal sight for the two nights we were there). Our room smelled funny, and in the kitchenette, a drawer was stuck open, the carpeting was gross and had holes here and there where nails stuck out, our tv was scratchy most of the time, and the shower leaked.The breakfast felt like running the gauntlet, and the coffee was like nothing I'd ever tasted before; and hope never to again. We had asked the concierge directions to the Metro and to a Tim Hortons, and both times we were misdirected. Timmy's lovers beware! Once you taste the coffee provided, you'll want to find the closest one!But over all, I can't complain too much. The beds were comfy, and the air conditioner worked well...Recommended for those who won't stay in their rooms very much, and the bonus being close to China Town and Old Port.\",\n",

Down the length of the hallway, the baseboard trim had been removed and the wallpaper was curling and tearing. There was no sign it was being repaired. In our room, a closet latch was broken and hanging off the wall. Not the kind of condition you expect at this price.',\n",

Three of us (a couple plus a single friend) were travelling together, so we called ahead to check if the suite had privacy between the bedroom and the living room/sofa bed area. I don't know if it was this phone call that made the difference but we were given a huge suite with completely separate bedroom, large kitchen/living area (see picture) large bathroom and loads of closet space - all this at a very reasonable cost. The room had all we needed - our only regret was that we could only stay one night. We were particularly impressed by the friendliness of all the staff, especially those on the front desk and the guys on the door responsible for valet parking. All of them went out of their way to help us with maps, directions, suggestions for sights and restaurants etc. If we go back to Montreal, we'll certainly stay here.\",\n",

I booked the two rooms directly through HI 800 number and asked for two rooms together, one a suite and one double, however, the rooms were separated by the elevators and not adjoining as requested. Not a problem for me but if the other room was going to be for my kids then I would have been livid since one only finds out about the problem after payment, check-in, etc.The hotel location is central and the secure indoor parking is worth it considering you still have your car in the morning. It was winter and we didn't have to worry about the snow removal problems that were encountered after a major storm went through.Breakfast was very good. Lots of variety even when we arrived a little late for the posted times. Well stocked buffet and nice staff all around.Rooms were nice and clean, good size and suite even had a dishwasher. Hallways were a little shabby. We were 7th floor and it was nice and quiet.\",\n",

       " \"I stayed here in October 2007 for two nights. I was extremely pleased with this hotel. The staff were incredibly nice and helpful, the location is close to the Palais de Congres, where I had a conference, and the price was very reasonable. The rooms are huge, because they're suites. I had two queen beds in one room, a kitchenette, and another room with a sleeper sofa. Lots of space. I definitely recommend this hotel.There were two negatives that subtract from my rating just a bit: First, the beds were not great; the mattresses were a little lumpy and could stand replacement. Second, it was a bit noisy. There was no noise from adjacent rooms, but the refrigerator in the kitchennetee was noisy when it went on, and the hotel is on a fairly busy street. It was mostly quiet enough at night, but (very loud) construction outside started up around 7:30am.\",\n",

So, I used Priceline, and received a rate at the 2.5* Holiday Inn Express for $65. I was hoping for something a little nicer, but in the end, the HI Express was just fine for this little trip.Check-in was quick and friendly, I was told about the breakfast times and that there was a business centre with free internet (very handy). Also free wireless in the rooms.The room itself was on the 6th floor - a nice suite with a balcony and kitchen - much more than what I was expecting. Nothing was luxury, but everything was comfortable and clean. The bed was firm but comfortable, and the shower had one of those big showerheads that I love.The breakfast in the morning was ample, if you like carbs - none of the hot items that I've seen at other HI Expresses (eggs, sausages) were available. Otherwise, it was ample, with lots of cereals, bagels, waffles, juices etc. Lots of seating too.Overall, a nice middle-of-the-road hotel. It's location on Rene Levesque is close to lots, but on a fairly uninteresting street. A few blocks to Ste Catherine shopping, near Chinatown, and a 15 minute walk from Old Montreal. This hotel is good, nothing exceptional, but for the price is good value for money.\",\n",

The location is OK - you can walk to several good areas within 10 minutes but there is little to nothing close to the hotel. Be warned the hotel is not 'all suites'. I booked through a 3rd party website and that was root of my bad experience there. I was given a non-suite room on the 3rd floor - a smoking floor, not my preference. If you like smoking the 3rd floor is for you. Not only does it reek of smoke, during my stay there were cigarette butts in the hallway for two days. The staff was friendly enough but did remind me twice that I didn't book directly with the hotel. I was a second class citizen. The buffet breakfast was great except for a busy Sunday morning when they were overwhelmed and broke down everything 2 hours before finishing time. I guess they ran dry. It was OK for my first time to Montreal in terms of location but I won't be staying there again.\",\n",

Our room 720 had a balcony with a view of Montreal towards the harbour. The kitchen does not have a stove, only a microwave. The room was quiet, and we did not hear any neighbours or the traffic. The AC is a window type, and worked well. All windows opened. There are 2 computers with internet access that you can get to with your hotel key, but they were quite busy. There's a laundromat $2 each for washer/dryer/soap. Breakfast was plentiful and included fresh fruit, but no meat or waffle maker. It was difficult to find a free table to use. The only drawback was the valet parking - totally unnecessary since the hotel has underground parking. The valets took our only key, so we had to bother them whenever we needed something from our vehicle. Everyone was friendly, spoke English and were very helpful. We liked the location, in between the port park and sites, and Mt. Royal and the underground mall and city centre.

Upon arriving we found that our room, instead of being a small single room as we expected, was actually a full suit with a second lounge room and a small kitchen. The entire hotel was very clean and the continental breakfast was not bad either.The hotel staff were very helpful and informative. They gave us clear directions to any place we asked of them, and were very knowledgeable about all the attractions in the city and were able to give us recommendations of where to go.

We thought it would be a good place for people with kids in tow. They were unable to join us but the hotel did not disappoint. As advertised, our room was a suite or more appropriately a small apartment. The bedroom was a decent size with TV cabinet, night stands and closet. The bedding was nice, although the mattress a bit soft. The bathroom was typical Holiday Inn, nothing fancy -- bring your own soap if you hate those mini bars of soap. The kitchen was great - full sized fridge, microwave, sink and dishwasher. There were dishes, plates, glasses, silverware, etc. The living room was a decent size w/ couch, desk, chair and another TV. The heating/cooling system took some getting used to but we managed as we needed both during our stay. The staff was reasonably pleasant. The housekeepers were very nice and the room was kept nice and clean. All in all, no complaints. Not fancy but perfectly acceptable and great location from St. Catherine Street where the main festival activities were located.

While this end of downtown isn't as posh as the more western end, it is perfectly safe.

The hotel hallways are a little rundown but the rooms are immaculate -- nicely furnished with high end linens, clean, and, a bonus for families, a small kitchenette for breakfast and lunches. The staff are extremely courteous. The complimentary breakfast is a cut above the usual continental with hard boiled eggs, a variety of cereals and toasts, coffee, fruit, pastries and juice.

The bathrooms are modern, well lit and very shiny too.There's a small pool, a sauna, and a small gym also.The Metro station is just across the street corner at Place d'Armes, so the whole city is easy to get to if you do not fancy walking. If you do want to walk, turn left and within five or ten minutes you can be in Old Montreal or down at the port. Both are very nice areas. The other way towards the modern vibrant parts of Montreal, and the underground shopping is a longer walk, but it's still easily witin reach. There are always taxis waiting outside for you if you wish.All told, I would describe this place as a very good business class hotel that would also suit tourists looking for a good comfortable base to see the wonderful city.\",\n",

We stayed in a one bedroom suite, it was very cozy. The bedroom was smaller then I expected, however, my in-laws had a bigger bedroom. Also the coach is sleeper sofa, so it converts to bed for another bed if need. The room had a fridge, a sink, cabinets, and microwave, coffee maker, and an electric kettle for hot water, no stove. Our room had a small balcony outlooking the major street, but traffic noise was not a problem, of course sirens could be heard if an ablunance drove by, but that happened once only during our stay. Our room was across the elevator, which was a downside, because people tend to be loud in the hallway, and while they way for the elevator, so sometimes you could hear people. The other downside to our stay, was roudy teenagers that stayed on our floor, they decided to go out at 12 am and were more then loud while they were leaving, and we could hear them outside. The breakfast was great, they had the same selection each morning, however, there was a lot to choose from. Mostly everyone spoke English, however, there were some employees, that were hard to understand their English. We booked from them a 3 hour tour, the night before we went, and its worth the money. The parking is a bit expensive, it was $14 per day. We would stay there again, if we ever come back to Montreal, I don't see the reason to spend much money of fancy hotel, when this is very clean, convinient, and very nice.\",\n",
       " 'We stayed for one night in May 07.We booked the day before and arrived late morning to enquire if we could leave luggage and car to avoid further parking costs. To our pleasant surprise we were booked in and given a room straight away.Surprisingly the room was a suite with kitchen and seating area etc. It was very clean and roomy. The breakfast was good and plentiful with alot of choice for a continentalThe staff were a mine of information and very willing to help especially the valet parking attendent we would have missed places if it was not for him.The location is ideal for the old town.Down side is the cost of parking',\n",
       " \"I visited Montreal with my boyfriend and a friend. I booked this hotel for the free continental breakfast. When we arrived we were amazed by how big the room (better said: apartment) was. The room has a walk-in closet, huge bed, huge space. The living room has a big space as well. It has a big kitchen and dining table for 3. It was the cleanest hotel I have stayed in a long time. The service was awesome too, as well as the breakfast (simple, but good). I would definitely recommend this hotel to anyone! As for the area, it is located in downtown, close to many amenities and chinatown. The area around wasn't so nice, but it was more or less the same around downtown too. A lot of homeless people and punk kinds. One final thing: you will not be able to buy alcohol at a store after 11pm.\",\n",
       " \"Great price, room and location. The Suite we stayed in was larger than we thought it would be. I thought the location was good, not in the heart of the city but if your willing to walk then this place is great. We walked all around the city from the hotel but then again we don't mind walking. I would recommend staying here if you want a clean nice place that is affordable and in a good location.\",\n",
       " 'Rooms are large and very comfortable. Looks like it was redecorated very recently. Separate bedroom, kitchenette and full size fridge, microwave are very practical. Might not be the funkiest spot in town, but close to everything. Staff was always friendly and efficient. Strongly recommended.',\n",
       " 'We loved the separate bedroom! The kids slept on the pull-out couch in the living room and we stayed up later in the bedroom. It was also great to have a kitchenette. We ordered take-out, which was so convenient with small children. The breakfast is also fabulous -- we all love their cinnamon rolls. The only problem is no pool. But other than that, everything was great.',\n",
       " 'My husband &amp; I and another couple stayed at the Holiday Inn Express for New Years Eve. We found the hotel to be very centrally located,our suite was very clean and the staff was friendly. We stayed on the 7th floor and had a wonderful view. This was our 2nd time staying in Montreal ( the first on our honeymoon in 2000) and we will return again possibly in the spring or summer. I would definetly stay at this property again.',\n",
       " \"whenever I have the opportunity to stay at a holiday inn express I take it and have yet to be dissapointed. The rooms at this location are huge. It has a mini kitchen with an almost full size fridge, sink, and microwave. The bed was more than comfy. The bathroom(very important for me) was roomy and extremely clean.The view from the hotel room was not great but the room was quiet and hey if I want the view i'll head up to the top of mount royal.The continental breakfast downstairs was above average for quality and quantity of food. the eating area was big enough that my morning paper was read in peace.The area of the city is not the nicest in montreal but you are within waking distance(not winter) to many attractions. old montreal, place des arts, palais de congress. Montreal pool room(fantastic steamed hot dogs and poutines).China town.Once the sun goes down the hotel is located in the part of town that is alittle seedy. even though montreal is a safe city some people might find it uncomfortable walking around, but the 24 hr doormen will be more than willing to call you a taxi to whisk you away to the city's neon lights. The hotel is very secure and at no time were there any issue with security. In the winter china town is walking distance as well as old montreal but most other spots of the city would be a taxi or metro ride. My only complaint if you want to call it that was the fact that the parking was limited and you pretty much had to use the valet parking which ran at 16.75 a day plus taxes, after 4 days it added up.The value of this hotel was great..location...service...clean....big rooms..and very well priced, I don't think you get a much better deal on the island of montreal.\",\n",

       " \"Expected the hotel to be good after reading the reviews - lived up to expectations and more!! Have stayed at many 'Expresses' and this was the best by miles. Staff were friendly, helpful, difficult to find anything on the downside! I noticed there have been comments about the area being seedy, I guess those writing that have led very sheltered lives - it's better than many inner city areas I've stayed in in North America. We were out very late most evenings and never felt threatened we were just aware as anyone should be out late at night in a city. There were a very few beggars on Ste Catherine but we were never approached, and all seemed young and friendly, mainly displaying boards for funds to buy 'weed' - full marks for honesty!!\",\n",
       " \"I first stayed at this hotel in 2003 when it was Hotel Suites Le Faubourg. This property is now partially owned by Holiday Inn. I have made 5 returns to this property, including most recently in October 2006, all staying at Holiday Inn Express rooms. ROOMSThese rooms are clean and spacious. It comes with a small kitchen area with a refrigerator, dishwasher, microwave, coffee maker, kettle, sink, bottle opener, and lots of empty cupboard space. Some have plates, cutlery and cups, otherwise they'll send you styro-plates and plastic cutlery. There is a small eating area with bar stools. The entertainment/office area is nice, with a 27&quot; TV and nice furniture (sofa-bed, chair, ergonomic office chair, desk, lamps, end tables, and entertainment stand). Separate bedroom is nice and large, with a closet, entertainment stand with 32&quot; TV, alarm clock, and night tables. Bathroom is nice, roomy, clean, and bright. Hall closet has an ironing board and iron. The internet worked well. Request a balcony, they are nice and overlook Old Montreal. Don't expect to get one, make sure you request it!COMPLIMETARY BREAKFASTIt's decent, and starts the day off right. Coffee, tea, hot chocolate, milk, cream, 3 kinds of juices (apple, orange, and cranberry), waffles, boiled eggs, small muffins, cinnamon rolls, bananas, grapefruit, 3 kinds of cereals, toast, and more. If you want to spend money go to Chez Cora's on St. Catharine.LOCATIONGreat location, as long as your mission isn't to drink the night away on Rue Crescent. It's close to Old Montreal (10 minute walk), close to the Eaton Centre (20 minute walk), close to 2 Metro stations, Chinatown (a couple blocks), and the Latin Quarter (15 minutes north on St. Denis). About a 25 minute walk to Rue Crescent for those who hunger the Toronto crowd. OVERALLHoliday Inn Express Centre Ville provides good value, however if you are staying for more than a few days, or enjoy having a full kitchen with a stove, head on over right next door to Les Suites Faubourg St. Laurent. It's the same building, same rooms, same amenities, same valet parking rates, and even the same furniture in many cases. Rates appear to be about the same. However Les Suites Faubourg St. Laurent rooms come with stoves, for those who enjoy cooking once in a while. That's what I enjoyed most when I first stay at this property 3 years ago prior to Holiday Inn, and I will give it a try once again on my next trip to Montreal. For those who do enjoy cooking, head west on Blvd. Rene Levesque for a 7-10 minute walk to the IGA for food and drinks.Reference Links - Holiday Inn Centre Ville - [--]Les Suites Faubourg St. Laurent - [--]\",\n",
       " \"Excellent, big suite rooms, digital TV services with latest movies available via 2 TV's (bedroom or living room), big bathroom with all the supplies and plenty of towels. . you don't wanna leave the room!!!The location is not that good, we found nothing of major interest nearby. The streets near the hotel didn't seem that safe either. Plenty of dirty back alleys with a bum or two begging for money.Our good standard breakfast experience seemed to invite all too many insects to the table, as they kept gathering over the plates for the whole time we were there. There were none of these in the guestrooms, so something could be made to correct the situation.\",\n",
       " \"The Holiday Inn Express at Centre-Ville is located on Rene Levesque near St. Laurent. We were automatically upgraded to a suite from a room with 2 queens, though the suite had a queen in one bedroom and a pullout double sofa bed in the living room. The sofa bed sadly sagged. Our suite faced the inner courtyard and was quiet. The air conditioning unit is very quiet and is located in the living room. The suite was clean and well maintained. The room was clean and relatively large. The internet is by ethernet cable, so make sure you bring your RJ-45 cable unless you want to work in the lobby area with wireless. The suite has two 27&quot; televisions and a kitchen area. The kitchen is a full kitchen, as the suite was designed to be a one bedroom apartment. The kitchen has a full size refrigerator, sink and dishwasher but no stove. There is a microwave. The staff is friendly and bilingual, though they do push too hard to get you to have your GST refunded automatically for a $7 charge. You can apply for the refund yourself for free. The free continental breakfast is pretty good with a good choice of breads, muffins and their cinnamon rolls, fruit, yogurt, hard boiled eggs, cereal and drinks. The drinks are too watery, and the branded smart roast coffee is too bitter. But then again, its almost free.  The location is near Chinatown and the Latin Quarter. But beware to the north and east are the adult areas that attract a seedier bunch though it did not feel unsafe to walk there during the day before dark. Old Montreal is to the south and about 5-10 minutes away. Parking is valet only and about $17/day. You don't want to park elsewhere and be careful not to park in the hotel zone only between 3-6 pm on weekdays on Rene-Levesque. Be careful driving in Montreal as the traffic is really bad with one way streets and no left turns during heavy traffic hours. Walk whenever you can.\",\n",
       " \"The fact that we were in a suite really made our stay worthwhile. For the price of a room consisting of a bedroom and bathroom, you also get a little living room, kitchenette with breakfast bar, and a terrace. It was great. Though we stayed inside one night due to torrential rains, our time spent indoors felt like we were in an arpartment instead of stuck in a bedroom. A Metro stop, St Laurent and St Catherine Streets are close by, though the immediate area, while not unsafe, is 'blah'. The portable a/c units were different, but functional and easy to deal with. Service was efficient and very friendly. The valet parking was reasonable. Overall a great value.\",\n",
       " \"Very family friendly! Spacious, clean, quiet!My husband, my 3-year-old daughter and I just returned from Montreal. We travel often to Montreal for long weekends, visiting festivals, family &amp; friends, and have stayed at several hotels in the downtown area. We especially like accessibility to pound the pavement, walk within the downtown core, near St. Catherines.This past weekend, we decided at the last minute to travel stay over Saturday and Sunday, and couldn't find a hotel room anywhere, even in any of our previous choices. So, I hesitantly chose the Holiday Inn Express- Centre Ville, based on other Trip Advisor reviews, and , because it was available! As others said -- clean, clean, clean!For anyone with young kids at hotels, you learn a couple of things....1) Don't really need elegant lobby areas with marble, fancy upholstery, and priceless antiques. 2) Do need space, elbow room, so it was really great to have a separate bedroom (really a junior one-bedroom apt) to put them to bed, and still give the parents a place to put your feet up and have a drink at night! The kitchen is a godsend, full-size fridge, microwave, bar stools, and a real kettle, not just coffeemaker, is great to have as we usually travel with some food items, order in food, fix some late-night snacks, or carry medicines.3) Let someone else struggle to park underground (valet - fixed daily rate) with your overloaded vehicle 3x/day while you schlep upstairs with kids is another godsend! Valets carted up bicycles, strollers, and other wheels to the front door in no time flat!4) Great closet space, two full closets &amp; large bathroom5) Don't need a big fancy $30 hotel breakfast for an egg &amp; bacon strip, your family needs their own favourites - included!6) Not just a family-friendly hotel, lots of diversity in the guests from the US &amp; beyond, couples, partners, all visitors!7) QUIET QUIET QUIET for sleeping at night ! Long weekend!Very few downsides -- if any:a) No swimming pool, but do have fitness centre &amp; internet b) No &quot;view&quot; to speak of, but we're familiar with Montreal and got our viewing in each &amp; every day. Will definitely make this our #1 Montreal choice for next few years!\",\n",
       " 'Stayed here for 4 nights, got a suite as standard and asked for and got a room with a view of the old town. Suite was roomy and had all the necessary facilites. Staff very helpful and friendly. In terms of location its central but inbetween areas so although there isnt much but other hotels and offices immediately around its around 5min walk to Town Hall and old town, about 10mins to Latin Quarter. Nearest Metro is Champs de Mars about 5mins away. I found the continental breakfast provided ok and having free broadband access in room was very convinient too. I had no trouble with noise as described by previous posts and I did stay a fri and sat night which is when I most expected to have these problems but maybe i was just lucky. With reference to the comments about the clubs etc in the area they are not directly near the hotel so unless you go out looking you probably won`t see anything. Only bad point was there was a fire evacuation on the last night I was there but of course that could happen anywhere. Overall I would recommend this hotel.',\n",
       " \"This hotel is in a fairly new building that was designed to have full apartments, not hotel rooms. This is a good thing. The building is concrete and very sound proof. Each room has its own hot water tank and apartment sized seperate kitchen (although most of the rooms lake a stove), they have a microwave, sink and fridge.The hotel is located only a couple blocks from Old Montreal (to the South),Chinatown (to the South-West), and downtown business district (to the West). Everything is walking distance. No need to bring a car.The Camp-De-Mars Metro (subway) station is two blocks to the East and one block to the South from the hotel, (if my memory serves me right anyway), which is easy walking distance.The hotel is on a major thrufare, Blvd Rene-Levesque Est, which has plenty of cabs too. My room was facing on to the inner courtyard, and it had thick double panel windows so I heard no traffic noise even on the 7th floor.This hotel uses floors 1 through 8 and 9-14 are used as apartments (who use a seperate side enterance and elevator).Service is exceptional and this is by far the best hotel I've stayed at... and it was cheaper than a lot!No flaws for my perfect vacation in Montreal (until I stayed at that awful Aeroport-Montreal Holiday Inn that is!).\",\n",
       " \"We arrived one day late to stay at our hotel and there was no problem (since Air Canada cancelled our flight to Montreal). We stayed in a one-bedroom room where my 4 year old son and I slept in the queen bed and husband opened up the sofa bed. There were 2 tv's and it was very roomy. The air conditioner is only in the bedroom, which stayed very cool, but the rest of the room was a bit warm, but we opened up the screen doors. No balconies, which is fine, because too scary with kids! The free breakfast every morning was great (ask for a tray and bring it all to your room) and coffee all day long. It is situated very close to Old Montreal and the Science Center - great for kids. Safe and clean. We used the washers and dryers also. The staff were very friendly. I'd stay there again!\",\n",
       " \"I want to preface my review by saying that my husband and I have traveled all over the world for both business and pleasure staying in hostels, dumpy motels, 4 and 5 star hotels as well as B&amp;Bs. The Holiday Inn Express was very clean, gave a generous sized room (I was told that there were queen beds only throughout hotel so if you need a King, you might want to call) complete with kitchenette, had a well supplied free breakfast, offered free high-speed internet in every room, had nice new furniture in the room (2006) and a helpful staff (with the exception of check-in when we arrived at 2:45pm and were told to wait in the lobby until 3pm because that's when check-in started...just silly). I would stay in the hotel again although I would prefer a room in Old Montreal.You might be saying to yourself...but when I search Tripadvisor for hotels in Old Montreal, this hotel is listed. This hotel is not in Old Montreal by any stretch of the imagination. It is a solid 15 minute walk to the heart of Old Montreal (a ten minute walk to the edge of Old Montreal). Of course, this hotel is a block away from Chinatown and since my husband and I are die hard dim sum and bun fanatics, we were in heaven. Back to location information though.Holiday Inn Express is indeed convenient like the other reviews mention. It is only two blocks to the Metro station and a good jumping-off point because of its central location if you are walking to various tourist destinations in the city.If you are not a seasoned traveler or have small children, I think you will take offense to this particular location because of the red-light and club/party district which is directly behind the hotel. Sex shops line this end of Blvd. St. Laurent as well as the nearby section of Rue Ste. Catherine. There is a sketchy skateboard park attracting some seedy characters a block behind the hotel as well as hookers along Boulevard St. Laurent once you hit Rue Ste. Catherine. We also saw the XXX billboard truck circling the neighborhood over and over again and parents with children who can read may not want to have to explain things like this or have their children eyeing the sex toys that are displayed in store windows on your walk to the Metro station. Did I feel safe? Yes. Anyone who has traveled to NYC or similarly large cities is used to this sort of thing and these types of characters and it probably won't faze them. I would feel a bit uncomfortable walking back from the Metro Station after dark, but certainly not to and from Old Montreal after dark. The area doesn't get dicey until after you cross Blvd. Rene-Levesque.Oh, one last hint, ask for a room in the rear of the hotel because while the view of Old Montreal is surely spectacular, Blvd. Rene-Levesque is a very busy and noisy road. We were on the side towards the rear on the 8th floor and could still hear loud cars, horns and motorcycles during the night. I was thankful that I read this tip from another user and took it to heart. I thought it was worth mentioning again.\",\n",
       " \"This is a standout pick for lodging in downtown montreal for two reasons.First location: The hotel it is kitty-corner to a Metro (subway) stop so you have a launching pad to go most anywhere. From this metro location, you also have underground walking access that will lead you to closeby Complex Dejardin (one of the downtown enlosed malls) and also the Place Des Arts concert facility. Of course you can just walk outside up to the closeby main shopping street (St. Catherines) as well . You are also right next door to the Chinatown strip. It's really a great location!Next, value: If you have an entertainment card, you can get a great price through the Holiday Inn website. I paid about $US 80 a night (plus taxes), for a Saturday stay, without the hassles of priceline/hotwire. I suspect you cannot beat that value for downtown stay.As for the Hotel itself, I had a room with a king King bed, and the rooms were extremely large and also clean. Beds were very comfortable. (my only quibble is the pillows were too thick/fat - but I have the same issue in most Hotels - must be me)The Hotel lobby is also fairly attractive with oriental themes.I can see why this Hotel is rated so highly on tripadvisor.\",\n",
       " \"Hi ! We just spent our Honeymoon here on May 15-20, 06. We were treated very nicely at all time by the staff!. We had a fire arlam on Thur. nite about 8:00pm and the lack of info from the staff on duty was a bit disconcerting,(turned out to be burnt pizza) but the Fire Dept. was promt and efficent. We had a 1 bedroom suite w/Balconey overlooking Old Town Montreal. It was large with a full kitchen w/breakfast bar w/stools and a living room area w/couch and chair, Desk w/chair, 2 TV's, 2 HUGE closets and more storage area than you can use in a week!. All you need to bring is your table service!. This is the most centrally located hotel you could find in town. We walked by most of the expensive boutique hotels and for the money YOU can't go wrong with this location! Restaruants, Grocery store, Shops!. We walked everywhere and saw everything on foot except our trip to Mt. Royal and driving around the city and suburbs. The area was very nice!. We walked at all times of the day and night and always felt safe!!!. I don't know about the people who wrote the negative review, but we felt FAR SAFER than we do at home. The town is much smaller that it sound!. The walks are easy to anywhere and we had rain everyday!. The only disapointment was the rain and lack of a crowd to make those area that needed it alive. Many place in Old Town were closed all week due to the rain!. This is the place to go to set up your base for a great visit!. A GREAT LOCATION!!!!. WE WILL RETURN AGAIN!\",\n",
       " \"Overall the hotel was alright for the price paid. While there was air conditioning in the living area, we were disappointed that the bedroom, a seperate area, was no air conditioned. Noise level was very loud at the hotel. The hotel's reasonable prices and proximity to Sainte Catherine Street make it a popular choice for young people heading up to Montreal for partying. There was constant partying in the rooms next to us and in the hallways, and hotel was reluctant and/or unable to do anything about it. A big plus was it's location very close to Old Montreal and Saint Denis Streets, two locations that contain some of the best restaurants in the city.\",\n",
       " \"I stayed here for the weekend and enjoyed it.I pre-paid ($99) for the room on the HI website about 3 or 4 weeks beforehand and saved about 20% .The rooms all have kitchens with a microwave, dishwasher and full-size fridge. (No cutlery or dishes). There is a grocery store at the complexe Desjardins a couple of blocks away (also you can park there to save some money over the hotel's parking).Included breakfast is fine.Some others have mentioned the neighbourhood - the street the hotel is on is fine.. it is just a stretch of St. Catherine north of the hotel and a short stretch of nearby St. Laurent that looks sketchy (Regardless, Montreal is a safe place). You shouldn't be concerned about this.Staff was a mixed bag - the woman who checked me in was completely blas, the man who assisted me later was very friendly and helpful.For the price I paid, I am quite satisfied.\",\n",

Upon arrival we (husband, son and I) were upgraded to a suite, with full sized fridge, microwave, a kitchen sink, and separate bedroom. Very clean and quiet; the staff is excellent; the concierge very helpful. Best of all was the free breakfast every morning which was plentiful and served in a big, sunny room. We walked to the old city from our hotel; also to the underground shopping mall at Place Ville Marie (8-9 blocks) and to the metro (around 3 blocks) to get to Centre Bell and Olympic Park. The only downer was the number of panhandlers we saw in the vicinity of the hotel, they were always there, but never in our face. Highly recommended!\",\n",
       " \"Date: March 22-26Mary: Maine, USAHotel is clean, staff is very friendly, we paid $99 American, included breakfast. Room was very spacious with two double beds and kitchette. We weren't there for the atmosphere so really didn't care about our view. Parking is $16 canadian.My friend and I needed a clean, affordable hotel stay as we had appointments for Lasik eye surgery. We wanted to be close to the clinic, but needed to save money,as Lasik is not cheap. The Clinic being on Rene-Levesque at 1250 and the hotel being at 155, just seemed appropriate and with the other reviews and the price, worked out perfectly. There is a Metro stop(2.50 canadian)close by, which is very clean. We were told to not walk down Rue de St. Laurent at night (red-light district) but felt okay during the day. Grocery store very close in Chinatown. Concierge recommended a good breakfast place called Le Avenue a bit away from the hotel but very worth it, menu is in french, but the wait staff speak english. Cab ride from Underground City to hotel is about $6-7 canadian. Give this hotel a try, you will not be disappointed.\",\n",
       " \"First off, let me just say this is in a fine neighborhood. I felt safer in this neighborhood than in many neighborhoods in Boston. You could easily walk to Old Montreal, the grocery store (IGA), the Latin Quarter, and could easily catch a cab out in front of the hotel. As with any urban setting, I wouldn't recommend that one walk alone, but I would say the same to someone walking in the city in New York, Seattle, or San Francisco.It was really cold when we visited Montreal but we still felt comfortable and found it quite easy to walk from the hotel to different places in the city. The hotel valet parking was reasonable, especially considering that all guests have in and out priveleges and it is is affordable compared to other area hotels.We had a great queen suite room that was clean. When requested, the front desk provided disposable plates and silverware for us to eat our take out. If you are planning on eating a significant meal in your room make sure you bring your own dishes/materials. The staff was friendly and welcoming, and were eager to show us how to get places on a city map they provided. When the concierge didn't know where a small out of the way restaurant we were going to (recommended to us by locals), he called the restaurant and pinpointed it on the map. Overall the staff was very nice.The included breakfast was very comprehensive on the weekends, including &quot;toastable&quot; waffles, muffins, fruit, hard boiled eggs, cereal, bagels, english muffins, and more. The staff at breakfast was very prompt about replenishing breakfast supplies. On the weekdays there was less overall food but the same selection -- this was okay as there were less guests.We found the restaurant very easily. Just use map quest or drive down Rene Levesque and you should be able to find it. We asked for a high floor with a view and were given a great room on the 8th floor (the top hotel floor -- there are condos up on above floors). The only problem with the room was that it was really dry because Montreal was having a couple of dry, cold days. We had a great view of the old city though. It was wonderful.The price was great compared to other comparable places. We got an $85 USD deal for a queen suite room from the Holiday Inn website. Don't waste your money going somewhere else! Overall a great experience that I would recommend to anyone.\",\n",
       " \"We recently came back from a trip to Canada where we visited Montreal &amp; Quebec City. We stayed in Montreal only a few days, but the hotel I booked there is definitely worth a recommendation to any of you, travelers. If you're looking for a neat and super clean, quiet hotel, which feels like home away from home, that's the place to be - Holiday Inn Express Hotel &amp; Suites MONTREAL CENTRE-VILLE. The staff is very friendly &amp; helpful, speaks English well. Check-in &amp; check-out were very fast. Indoor valet parking is available for CAD$10 per day and service is very fast and efficient too. We left skis on the car rack, we didn't have to worry about it. The suite is really large and very clean, looks very new and unused. Kitchenette - (kitchen furniture, fridge, microwave, coffee maker, electric kettle, no utensils or pots, pans though) with bar stools. Bathroom - bathtub - very clean - new curtains, soft &amp; easily absorbing water, 100% cotton towels, new massage Kohler showerhead, hair shampoo, body lotion &amp; hair conditioner (products by Lord &amp; Mayfair). Living room - cozy &amp; comfortable sofa and armchair, tv, internet, tv games option, paytv. Bedroom - so, so cozy, the most comfortable bed so far :-), huge closet, tv in a bedroom. Light in the suite is very soft and warm, lots of options to adjust it to your liking. Separate in the kitchen, living room, bedroom, entrance hallway. The furniture isn't tacky and is really made to use. So many hotels carry sofas or armchairs you don't even want to seat in, because they're uncomfortable. One more thing - it's so quiet - our suite (no.172 or 173 - 7th floor I think) had windows facing small street, no view though). The continental breakfast was a real breakfast (choice of teas, coffee, milk, juices, cereals, pancakes, choice of fresh bread, toasts, fresh fruit, boiled eggs, fresh muffins, jams, peanut butter, yoghurts etc.) Everything was delicious and fresh). Breakfast is served downstairs, at reservation desk floor, it looks like a little cafeteria with tv, there is a whole section where food is offered as buffet. There's also a lady to help if you need anything. I noticed they also have a gym room with treadmills, etc., but we haven't used it. There is no restaurant in the hotel - we had a problem with finding an open restaurant on Xmas Eve - most of the places were closed.I think the hotel was recently renovated. To me it looks like it was built recently. In one sentence - a great deal if you're looking for a moderate price hotel.Forgot to mention the price: I booked a 1 bedroom suite for the Christmas time, CAD$104 per night including continental breakfast. 1 bedroom suite accomodates up to 4 people I believe. Once you stay there, you get spoiled with the space. You go to another hotel where you've got only one room and bathroom, you want to go back .We had a great time, if planning another trip to Montreal, we don't have to worry about chosing hotel. Check the map of Montreal for tourist attractions - it's close to the Old Montreal and Chinatown, within walking distance to many places, metro is close &amp; convenient.If you have any questions please email me at aga-gallery@earthlink.net\",\n",
       " 'First impression:Nice hotel but not too easy to find. We passed the hotel several times without being able to see the entrance sign which is badly positioned. But eventually we got into the hotel and were quite happy with our spacious and well appointed room. Other reviews mentioned the neighborhood but to me its like a typical one for a big city. Old Montreal is only 5 minutes away by foot and the busy downtown (witch has some really shabby spots)can be reached in less than 10 minutes. the next metro station (e.g. for visiting the olympic stadium) is also just a short stroll away. So alltogether the holidy inn express is a good choice if you want to explore Montreal.',\n",

The bed was very soft with a fluffy comforter. There was a kitchenette with fridge, microwave, and sink. The kitchen and the free breakfast was not really necessary since Chinatown was only 2 blocks away and we can go eat there any time. But those ammenities were still nice to have. There's free internet in the business center. The gym was not bad also, even had a TV in there. The metro was about 3 blocks away, on the other side of Chinatown. Vieux Montreal was about 6 blocks away. So the location was very convenient. There was always people walking around at all times of the day or night, so it's pretty safe to walk around at night. I would definitely stay at this Holiday Inn Express if I was to visit Montreal again!\",\n",
       " \"Having found the hotels I had stayed at in Montreal in years past to be booked up, and others expensive, I settled on what I figured would be a very economy class experience. To my pleasant surprise, my room was very large, with a full kitchen (fridge, sink, microwave), a large bathroom with very nice toiletries and a spacious bed. When it happened that it wouldn't stop raining, the hotel had large umbrellas ready for any guest who needed one. I would defintely recommend this hotel.\",\n",
       " \"Just wanted to say I agree with the general consensus. This hotel is in a very central location to St Catherine St, Place Des Arts, Chinatown, Old Montreal, the Latin Quarter, undreground shopping, and a couple Metro stops. The double room was very clean and fresh smelling as were the bed linens and towels. The kitchenette was clean, but austere. There were no plates or utensils in the room. A call to the front desk was all it took to quickly get some paper and plastic plates and utensils to our room. The business room has two computers with internet access and a laser printer, and usage of each was included in the lodging. I didn't take advantage of the breakfast, fitness room, or hotel parking so I can't comment on those. Best of all were the courtious and helpful staff. The front desk attendant gave me some candid answers to my questions about parking options in the area (street parking is free on the weekends if you can find it; we did), and the concierge took extra time to help us find information about the Film Festival going on at the time. Total price paid with tax: C$145. I would add to the comment made by another reviewer that the area of town is sketchy or potentially unsafe: I disagree. Certainly there were some homeless that hung out a couple corners down, but I was never once interrupted for money or bothered whatsoever. A surprising difference from many other cities I've visited.\",\n",
       " 'We made our reservation for 3 people and found the sofa bed to be unmade. We had to request sheets and then make up the bed ourselves. Also, the air conditioning unit was a free standing unit which was very loud and took up a lot of space. Service was OK but not great. The area did not seem too good. We were told to make sure that we parked in an underground parking garage so that the car would be undamaged in the morning.',\n",
       " \"Cannot fault the hotel. Large room with good kitchen. The hotel staff were friendly and helpful. Also a very good complimentary breakfast The location of the hotel, however, was not that great. A little on the outskirts of the main tourist areas with some rather seedy looking areas in close proximity. My wife and I did not feel completely at ease when walking back to the hotel at night. Although I'm sure our nervousness was unecessary. During our two week stay in Canada we stayed at both Montreal and Toronot and I must admit we preferred Toronto.\",\n",
       " \"Pros - We had HUGE one bedroom suite. Nice large kitchen. Free breakfast in the morning. Wonderful location for going to the Gay Village or shopping on Saint Catherine St.Cons - It was very hot weather and our room only had an air conditioner in the bedroom, so the living room got a little warm.Overall, I'd say for the price and quality of the room there's no where else I'd rather stay when in Montreal.\",\n",
       " \"My sister and I stayed at this hotel just this past weekend. I chose it based on the reviews I read on trip advisor and was more than pleased. The room we stayed in was a one bedroom suite with kitchenette and living room. It was perfect! There was a TV in the living room area, and in the bedroom which is good if you can't agree on what to watch when you crash after a long day.Old Montreal is a less than 10 minute walk away. I would highly recommend a little restaurand called Jardins Nelson. They have an open garden area where you can sit, and live jazz is always playing in the evenings. It was perfect.For Shopping St. Catherine St. is about a 10 minute walk with lots of unique shops. We walked most of the street and were too tired to walk back, so we took the subway system which was very easy to figure out and pretty clean.If you're thinking of doing some cooking in the kitchenette (which only has a microwave), make sure to bring some plates and cutlery. There is nothing of the kind in the room, not even glasses. Odly though, there was a dishwasher in our kitchenette.The morning breakfast bar was really nice. Tons of stuff, you'll be more than full.The only complaint I have is the airconditioning. It worked fine, but because the airconditioner was in the living room, I found the bedroom to be significantly warmer in temp. It didn't bother my sister at all, but just a heads up for those sensitive to the heat.Overall, I would definately go back. The best part was how clean the room was. That's always the most important, and in this case there were no worries.I have no problems recommending this hotel.\",\n",
       " \"My family of 4 had spent 2 nights at the Holiday Inn Express Montreal Centre-Ville on Aug 8-10 with 2 beds and a kitchenette. As we arrived, the hotel staff was friendly and very helpful from the time we entered the door. Location was a key factor on reserving at this hotel as it was walking distance to Old Montreal (very beautiful), Chinatown, and Ste Catherine Street for shopping. Hotel Room was clean, and A/C was a portable one which was sufficient. We had asked for a crib for our daughter at the time of booking which was set up once we checked in. We also enjoyed the kichenette which made thing easier in preparing meals for a toddler. Another plus was the Continental Breakfast which was complimentary every morning. Everything was fresh and abundent. Overall, a good hotel that i'd probably reserve again.\",\n",
       " 'My family and I stayed in this hotel in July 2005. We had an excellent 2-bedroom suite with a large TV in each of the 3 rooms. All rooms had air conditioning and very large wardrobes. The suite was tastefully furnished and the beds were excellent. The ensuite bathroom was also of a very high standard. The (North American) Continental Buffet breakfast was wide and varied in comparison to all other such breakfasts encountered on our trip, although the breakfast area was very busy. The staff were very helpful and readily spoke English unlike some places in Montreal and other parts of Quebec Province. Everything about this hotel was excellent with the one exception that it lacked a swimming pool. The Hotel is in an excellent location, just minutes from Vieux Montreal in one direction and the modern city centre in the other. All in all, a great city centre hotel at a very reasonable price. Book early to get the best price.',\n",
       " \"Two friends and I stayed at the Holiday Inn Express in Montreal on July 21st, 2005, for one night. Our friend booked the hotel after reading the good reviews on this site. We're glad she did!Location: Good location, in between the major streets of St. Denis and St. Laurent. Close to beautiful Old Montreal. Very easy to get to from the highway, you don't need to navigate your way through annoying one way streets to get there! I would suggest when you get there, you park and leave the car at the hotel. Walking in Montreal is great, lots of people watching and things to see. The metro is the best way to get around. Service: Our room was not ready when we first arrived around noon, but they allowed us to park our car and keep our luggage at the hotel as they got it ready. We walked to a nearby place for a great lunch, came back, and they gave us our room key. Unfortunately when we walked in we found it was not cleaned, but no problem - we called the front desk and they sent someone up to us right away with keys to a different room down the hall that was spotless and ready to go. Room: Very spacious, clean and nice. Everything is new. Suite was the same price as a room, so we booked that - had a kitchen and living room area with a pull out couch, and a seperate bedroom with a queen size bed. Air conditioners in each room. Very comfortable, and again, CLEAN, which is the most important thing! Not super fancy, but good for the price.Breakfast Buffet: Unfortunately we didn't get to see this as we didn't realize it stopped at 10am on weekdays. Breakfast is one of the best meals to eat out in Montreal anyhow, so we made the most of it.Parking: Valet, $20 a night. The Valets are great and very helpful. I think this cost is standard at all Montreal hotels.I lived in Montreal for 6 years and saw a lot of different hotels when guests were visiting. All in all, if you are not looking for a fancy place, but a clean, reliable hotel that is close to the attractions, this is a great deal.Enjoy!\",\n",
       " \"Good location midway between Old Montreal and Saint Catherines Street. The concierge service was friendly and helpful from the moment we got there and the room was very large and even included a kitchenette and free internet. The only real problem was the AC unit. It was one of those indoor stand-alone units and it was not nearly powerful enough to cool the spacious room during the relatively hot and muggy days we stayed there. To make matter worse, it was leaking water from the condenser and the floor was soaked all around it. Still, the hotel had pretty much everything else you could ask for, including continental breakfast and a gym. Just don't expect any frills or a really cool room.\",\n",
       " 'My husband &amp; I stayed at the Centre Ville June 24-June 27, 2005 at a rate of $138 CAD a nite booked onlne. Location: blocks from Old Montreal, $6 taxi ride from the train station. Trolley tour of the city will pick up at this hotel. Easy to get a taxi at hotel. Breakfast: lots of variety, fresh fruitStaff: very helpful!Room: portable AC unit was barely adequate even when left running all day so it was cool enough at night for sleeping. Another unit was in living room area. When I made the reservation online, I requested a king-size bed; however, when we arrived, we were told the hotel had no king beds, only queen. Having the suite was very nice since we had friends meet us there and they were able to stay with us. Kitchen: microwave, frig, dishwasher &amp; sink; HOWEVER, no dishes!! We requested paper plates &amp; plastic forks &amp; spoons, which the staff delivered quickly. Convenience store &amp; grocery store: Mini-mart is 1 block away on same side of street inside a dorm. IGA grocery store about 3 blocks away. Seemed safe after dark. Overall an excellent hotel for us and would stay there again.',\n",
       " \"This hotel had the lowest rate during the famous jazz festival in montrealwhen i checked in the room was said to be ready but on inspection was not-the bins had not been emptied and there were wet towels in the bathroom from previous occupantsThe hotel cleaned it up quickly and i had no further problems again, the room was cleaned well on the rest of my 8 night stay, the hotel is next to a small park which is frequented by 'social outcasts' but they posed no problem, the occasional pan handling thats all.The location is good for all the festivals-right in downtown-10 minute walk to the jazz festival and the place de arts, subway closeby alsoExcellent buffett breakfast-so few hotels now offer this included with room rate-it sets you off great for the start of the dayOverall i would reccomend this hotel for comfort/location/value and would have no hesitation to stay here again.\",\n",
       " 'This Holiday Inn express provides good value for the (not very inexpensive) price. The big rooms, and the kitchenette, the breakfast and free internet are all important to me in a hotel, and this hotel comes through on all counts.However, visitors should know the following in advance:1. the kitchenette has NO dishes, utensils, not even glasses. Bring your own, bring some up from breakfast or you will not be able to use the kitchen.2. There is absolutely no way we could find to avoid the parking charge which seems to be up to $16 a day (with taxes this becomes $19 a day).3. This has been said before - many rooms do not have AC in both the living area and bedroom. We travel with two little kids, and the living area was not air conditioned. The vents are not connected to anything. The bedroom had a portable AC unit, and by the time we had everything unpacked we were too lazy to ask to be moved - so make sure in advance!4. This is sort of trivial, but... $142 canadian is actually $23 more per night - $2 a night city tax, and two more taxes added on - so budget accordingly!The reception and parking staff were very helpful, the other staff could be better: we had a toilet overflow, and while it was repaired when we were out of the room, the sewage soaked towels were left on the bathroom floor. Also, we had a maid enter the room despite the &quot;do not disturb&quot; sign we carefully placed the night before.All this said, we had a great time, having the extra room was a real bonus, and we would stay there again.',\n",
       " 'Like all HI Express hotels, the room rate includes free local phone calls and a continental breakfast. What makes the HI Express-Montreal unique is each hotel is an apartment with a full kitchen (coffee maker, large refrigerator, microwave and tea kettle), breakfast bar, living room (with TV) and separate bedroom (also with a TV).The hotel location is close to old Montreal and only a few blocks from the Palais des Congres convention center.',\n",
       " \"The only reason that I didn't rate this hotel as &quot;Excellent&quot; is because the walk from the St. Laurent Metro to the hotel is less than desirable (if you are a woman walking alone). You don't want to walk from the St. Laurent Metro at night......I just returned from a 5 day stay at this hotel. I stayed in a non-smoking 1 bedroom suite. The entire floor was non-smoking and I never smelled smoke in the hallways which can be a problem in other hotels, since many people smoke in Montreal. The clean room was spacious with two televisions, full refrigerator, microwave, king size bed, living room and work desk. The hotel has a business center on the first floor with free internet service and printing. The complimentary continental breakfast was good and the staff was helpful. The IGA grocery store and Complexe Desjardins shopping mall was a five minute walk from the hotel. The well-stocked IGA grocery store included delicious take-out meals that you just heat in the microwave. Unfortunately, the weather during my week in Montreal was bad (thunderstorms and rain everyday), so I was not able to explore as many outdoor tourist attractions. During the summer (July), Montreal must be beautiful. A highlight during my trip was taking the Grayline tour to Quebec City. Quebec City was charming and wonderful! On my next trip, I want to stay in Quebec City instead of Montreal, since you really feel like you are staying in a French/Foreign city in Quebec City. Montreal was very &quot;Americanized&quot; and reminded me of an East Coast American city. The Underground City was nice, since the outside weather is usually bad in Montreal, but after a couple of days, the Underground City feels like walking around a huge American mall that never ends.....I was slightly disappointed with the city of Montreal, since I didn't expect to see the many grafitti walls, trash on the sidewalks/in the streets, rundown buildings, XXX theatres/businesses in areas that were not designated as the &quot;red light&quot; district (many of the X-rated businesses are near major tourist attraction areas, shopping malls), etc. I plan to return to Montreal in the future, but now I will have a more realistic view of the city and know that it doesn't look like the photos in the tourist brochures....\",\n",
       " \"I see lots of rave reviews about this hotel, but in my experience, it was just okay. Nothing special. My family (2 adults, 2 small kids) stayed in a one-bed suite, but unlike the previous review, our suite was very small and a bit scruffy (and also did not have integral air conditioning). The bedroom only had space for a full (double) bed. Perhaps it's because I paid a lower rate of 106 CAD (ichotels internet special)!! Even though we were on the 14th floor, the room was noisy, partly because of the location (right downtown) and partly because there was an area around the window where the tubing for the huge air conditioning unit (which took up more valuable space!) was not completely sealed.....and the air-con unit wasn't even on, so it could have been noisier! The hotel is in a slightly scruffy area, but it seemed safe to walk at night, although we were told to avoid areas just north of the hotel on St. Catherine's. The hotel is however in a good location for walking to Chinatown, Old Montreal and St. Catherine's (the nicer part!)...Overall, I would say it still presented reasonable value for money, considering the rate I got, but I would not want to pay anymore and will try somewhere else next time.\",\n",
       " \"I'm writing this while sitting in one of the suites.First off the suites are BIG. Yes, they are bigger than some 1 bedroom apartments. Clean and modern. They lack central air conditioning, but have 1-2 portable units per suite, one in the bedroom and one in the livingroom. Make sure you get a suite with 2, our first suite had only 1, and it was hot (30+ degrees celcius outside). The rooms were a little smokie (other rooms on the floor are smoking rooms) but after a little airing out they were fine. One bedroom with queensized bed and double hide away bed outside. Big shower tub - very clean.The kitchen was big (microwave, fridge, cofeemaker and dishwasher, no stove?) but had no cutlery. I almost think this building was built as a apartment building then converted or is going to be converted. 2 TVs with french and english cable chanels, PPV of course. Free ethernet internet (weak wireless signal is present). 2 phones. The desk service for the most part was good. One grumpy receptionist, but the concerge and the valet were very polite and even tried to get us tickets to a sold out show.There is NO parking around the hotel. The valet service is the only option, and it's secured underground according to the valet. $12 a day. If you plan on being downtown you could probably get away without a car as the metro is walking distance. Otherwise just factor that into the price.For the price of $135 CDN per night I cannot complain at all. The immediate neighbourhood is somewhat sketchy. Like being downtown in any large city. A few street people. But two blocks over is chinatown, which is very nice, one block east is St. Denis (where the locals go to drink/eat/party) and one black north is St. Catherines (where the tourists go to show/drink/eat/party). The conference center is less than a 10 minute walk away. (probably 5 minutes, but you have to wait for the lights). All in all a very nice hotel for the price. I would comeback anytime.\",\n",
       " \"This is a very nice hotel !! It is very clean throughout, everywhere. The rooms are quite spacious and cozy, very comfortable. Having a complete kitchen (full sized fridge, microwave, sink, dishwasher, coffee/tea maker, kettle, etc) was terrific !! I had a suite, ie., main room and bedroom with queen sized bed. I was here last week for 2 days, but would have liked to stay longer. The breakfast buffet was quite nice and filling, lots to choose from. The breakfast room had a nice cozy feel to it, very relaxing. You can even sit in the breakfast room after breakfast hours and read a complimentary paper (in English or Francais) and have a coffee or tea. They have the coffee and tea brewing here on hand all day long! No one bothers you, it is enjoyable! Staff was nice/okay; they were very efficient in their jobs. I would like to make a comment on the area of the hotel; it is okay, not bad bad as some reviewers have said. Just use your 'street smarts' like anywhere else. TIP: If you are using the Metro (subway) at night and you want to avoid the 'seedy' areas when you leave the subway for the hotel, then take the subway station called CHAMP DE MARS on the orange line. It is a couple of blocks south of the hotel; you will avoid the socalled seedy area completely. Overall it is a terrific hotel, I have no complaints as such. I paid $119 per day for my room/suite. Breakfast is included of course.I would definitely stay here again. It is like a home away from home. There is a big IGA grocery store 3 blocks away at a mall called COMPLEXE DESJARDINS -- easy walking distance. So you can bring stuff back to your room for a snack or nightcap, drink, etc.Double thumbs up on this hotel !!\",\n",

The main shopping areas of St. Catherine Street and the train station are a couple of subway stops or short taxi ride.  The staff are very friendly, welcoming and helpful. The rooms are clean, spacious and well appointed. I stayed twice within a week either side of a couple of days in Quebec City. Both rooms were suites, the first with amazing views across to city hall; both huge, super-comfortable beds and sofas, kitchen areas with fridge, freezer and microwave.

The rooms are very clean and nicely furnished, from the handy kitchen area to the big bathrooms. There were some nice complimentary soaps and big white towels. The kitchen has everything you need to prepare a meal with groceries from the nearby IGA, which stocks beer, wine, and some nice gourmet foods.If you have a kid or two, the separate bedroom is a great thing to have. Both the bedroom and the living room have full-cable television, including a number of kids' channels.The staff was very helpful and friendly throughout our stay, and at 14.00 a day, the valet parking is a deal, considering it costs about that much to park in other lots around the area. You might find a spot on a distant street if you don't mind hauling your bags, but there seemed to be lots of parking restrictions in the neighborhood.The reviewers who complain about the neighborhood are overreacting, and obviously haven't done much walking around in a major city.

Valet parking was really the only option since many streets have signs forbidding overnight parking (and apparently the neighbourhood isn't the best).

You have to walk a few minutes to get into what might be considered an unsavory area, but walk south, east, west and there is no problem. A few blocks away is Chinatown where we had GREAT dim sum. A few blocks west on Rene Levesque enter the IPA grocery store for a fine treat those who love gourmet food. Continue through the back of the store to the underground mall and access to St. Catherine St. and downtown. The rooms were large with separate bedroom and sitting area. Very nice kitchen with broiler, coffee maker, and microwave. Spotless and the staff could not be more informative and polite. We will stay there again you can be sure!',\n",
       " \"The good: The Hotel-Suites Le Faubourg is a very modern, clean, well-run hotel, and we found the bilingual staff helpful, professional and courteous. On Expedia, I got a rate of about $110 US, which seemed quite good. Airline pilots and crew stay here, as do lots of tourists and business types. Rooms (ours was actually a junior suite) are good-sized, with a kitchen, a narrow sitting-room, and decent-sized bedroom; the bed was comfortable, and there are nice TVs in both rooms (yes, Virginia, some of the channels are even in English). Four people could share the suite, but only if you don't spend too much time in the room. Our suite looked out on the courtyard, so it was quiet; the view is on the dull side. The windows actually open. The usual amenities are provided: hair dryer, coffee maker, dataport, etc. No mini-bar, and there isn't a bar in the hotel, so bring your own drinks and snacks from the IGA a few streets over. Valet parking in the hotel garage is $14/day; you mightn't want to park on the street overnight. The &quot;Continental&quot; breakfast served in the attractive lobby is quite generous: all manner of baked goods, breads &amp; bagels, waffles, cereal, fruit, yogurt...The bad: there's nothing even remotely *bad* about either the Faubourg or its staff. Would I stay here again? Probably, depending on my finances. But if you need a romantic getaway or want charm when you walk out the front door, spend the extra money (in some cases, *lots* of money) and stay in Vieux-Montral (the old city). This is because of...The ugly: the Blvd. Ren-Levesque along this stretch runs through what realtors like to call a &quot;changing&quot; neighborhood. Another guest remarked in a review that the neighborhood immediately to the North (around Rue St.-Catherine) seemed &quot;scary&quot;. Well, that depends on what scares you: the three-block walk up to the St.-Laurent Metro stop didn't feel *scary* so much as dreary and then sleazy: street-people types, sex-video places, scruffy-looking clubs. It's a little better--but longer--to walk thru Chinatown to Place-d'Armes station or east to Berri-UQAM (Universit de Qubec a Montral). In short, it's not as bad an area as some of the hotel districts in NYC or San Francisco (or even Paris). Just don't expect Disneyland.BTW, the Mtro is excellent and safe, and goes basically everywhere you'd want to visit except the top of Mount Royal; it's also *very* warm, even in the dead of a killer Montral winter: shed your coat as you descend or prepare to sweat. This goes for the &quot;underground city&quot; concourses as well. The locals seem to like it this way. I made the mistake of wearing a sweater, instead of just carrying it, during one underground foray: THAT was a bad idea. Quite a few of the stations are worth seeing for their architecture and public art; I've visited twice and haven't even seen most of them.A final word for those who, having read a few of the other reviews, might wonder whether Montral is worth visiting: it certainly is, especially if you enjoy vibrant, historic, cosmopolitan cities. There's tons of stuff to do, see, eat, buy and enjoy, no matter what your age or interests. As in any great city, there are lots of beautiful areas, as well as lots of ugly areas, sometimes right next to one another. But it's absolutely worth your time to explore, even if you don't speak a word of French.\",\n",
       " \"We spent 5 nights here in August. The rooms are great -- as big as many a 1 bedroom apartment, with a full sized fridge, 2 TV's, full size desk. The room (and the hotel) was very clean and bright. Our view was of a vacant (and not pretty) lot. Continental breakfast (with toaster) was perfectly decent, with many choices.The big &quot;but&quot; -- which no other reviewer has mentioned -- is the location. While it is reasonably close to downtown and Chinatown, if you go north 1 block you are in the middle of a really unsavory, ugly red-light district. The sex stores, the drug addicts and the extreme bikers were unreal. We're from New York and this beats anything we've got now (and maybe even Times Square at its old-time worst). It's as if every low-life sin in Montreal was crammed into about 4 blocks. We got out of there fast (with our two young sons) and never turned that way again!! If you don't want that a block away from your hotel, find some place else to stay. If you don't mind -- this is a great find. To be fair, we saw no trace of this blight at or in front of the hotel itself, and we would stay there again.\",\n",
       " 'We recommend this hotel for its convenient location and for the friendliness of staff. It is within walking distance of the Old Quarter, Chinatown and many of the eateries and shops on St. Denis and Sainte Catherine. Other touristic spots readily accessible from metro stations. It is straightforward and modern, and a good choice for families. The only problem we encountered was a lack of air conditioning in the main room (which housed the sofabed) so that our son was a little too warm and had trouble sleeping. Our bedroom had the powerful a/c unit and we had to crank it up to try and help move cooler air into the other room. This would be an issue on very hot days, which they had been experiencing. We did not inquire about additional help, but they might have a solution, if approached. Otherwise, an excellent choice.',\n",
       " 'We just returned from this hotel spending 3 nites . Great place. Its clean, the service is very good and the rooms are large. We stayed in junior suite which had one bedroom, living area with a foldout and kitchenette. all new appliance and bath was good size. Hotel is a great location. 8 min. walk to Old Montreal. 15 minute to downtown and few blocks from the Metro. Great deal.',\n",
       " \"I chose this hotel online and had no idea what to expect. The hotel was wonderful. It was clean, modern and well kept. The one bedroom suite rooms were small by US standards (in my opinion) but quite adequate for a family. It was great having a large refrigerator. We stocked it with drinks and snacks from the IGA nearby. The breakfast was great and saved us an additional expense. I would advise getting a map from the front desk when you arrive. They will circle various areas for you so you don't wander into less desirable areas near the hotel (this is especially important if you have children with you). Old Montreal (Place Jacque Cartier) is down the hill a block and a half from the hotel. We had a great time, enjoyed the hotel and will definitely stay here again when we go back next year.\",\n",
       " \"The Le Faubourg Hotel was a perfect place to stay during our recent visit to Montreal. The staff was friendly and helpful, the room was spacious and squeaky clean and the location was pretty good.The hotel is less than a 15 minute walk to Old Montreal, after a quick walk through the colourful and vibrant Chinatown. Additionally, it is very close to a Metro station that would pretty much take you anywhere.The streets behind the hotel are rather &quot;urban,&quot; with the occasional coffee cup and miscellaneous trash blowing by your feet, but c'est la vie. If you don't like urban grit, stay in Connecticut.Overall, the hotel is a good value. The add-on's add up pretty quick, ($14 per night parking... pay-per-view movie...) but you can easily make up for it by chowing down their Continental breakfast before you hit the town for an $8 crepe. We'd gladly stay here again.\",\n",
       " \"This new hotel is definitely the best value in Montreal. It may not be located near the other high-priced hotels, but it's location may be better. I was with a group of friends that had 2 rooms here. We did a lot of walking, within a couple minutes of Chinatown, St. Catherine St and Old Montreal. When we did take cabs, it was pretty cheap ($6 to Crescent St and/or St. Laurent St for bars &amp; clubs). It is also situated within 2 blocks of 2 Metro stations, which we used to go to Olympic Stadium for an Expos game. The suites are large and contain all new furniture. With a queen bed in the bedroom and a fold-out sofa in the living area, the suite easily slept the 4 people in our group. The suite also contained a kitchen with coffee machine, toaster oven, microwave, stove, and large refrigerator. The bathroom was similar to most hotel bathrooms. Our friend's room had a balcony overlooking the street the hotel is located on - Ren-Lvesque Est. There is also a large IGA supermarket a couple blocks down where we bought lots of stuff to stock our fridge. The continental breakfast is adequate, with croissants, cereals, hard-boiled eggs, waffles, and coffee/juices. The staff, from the front desk to the concierge, to the night manager was EXTREMELY helpful. Though all rooms are supposed to have an iron to go along with the ironing board, ours did not. When we requested one, the night manager came to our room, explained that there weren't anymore available, but brought his own personal iron for us to use. Now that's service. If you're traveling to Montreal, I highly suggest this hotel - especially if you're traveling with kids and/or a large group and/or are budget minded. I'll be there when I return to Montreal.\",\n",
       " 'We stayed one night at the Residence Inn after arriving on a flight from out of town. We called for the shuttle which arrived within about 15 minutes. The hotel was about a 10-15 minute drive. It was not real easy to find if you were driving yourself. Check in was fine and the room was fine. We had a family of 4 staying and found the suite to be a little crowded but still nice. The breakfast in the morning was the typical free breakfast with a few hot items. On our way back home we were to stay there one more night but opted for the Fairfield Suites instead. We thought it was an upgrade from the Residence Inn plus it was closer to the airport. The staff at the Fairfield was extremely helpful. The downside to the Fairfield was you paid for parking if you had a car, you occasionally heard a plane since you were so close, it was not easy to find the turn in as others have stated and you can not walk to any restaurant or shopping. But, given those issues, my family still preferred the Fairfield and I preferred the lower price and the great help and advice at the Fairfield. I would recommend either for a stay as both were fine.',\n",
       " 'We stayed 4 nights in Oct 2008. The hotel is very clean and rooms are spacious. It offers the best breakfast we have ever had at a hotel. The staff was extremely pleasant and helpful. We will definitely stay here again.',\n",
       " \"I stayed at the Residence Inn 6/16 through 6/20. I was originally booked at the Courtyard which is next door and accessible by the Residence Inn but changed it due to the lower per night cost and the availability of a free breakfast.Checking in was a bit slow. There was only one young lady working the front desk during the peak check in time, Monday evening. She was friendly and helpful. I even got a lower rate since I had a mega bucks certificate and was even able to use it!I had a king studio room which I loved. There was a microwave a full size fridge, stove, and utencils. I found the room very comfortable and clean.Breakfast was good. Loved the croissants in the morning. I always took an extra one and a piece of fruit with me.It is short drive to Trudeau. If you have a rental car, I suggest filling up near this hotel. There are two pumps close by. The hotel is near Cote-Vertu (shopping mall) I found it closes too early to enjoy after work. There are some nice restaurants within walking distance on a nice day.The Residence Inn is a great value. I think it's like an Embassy Suites without the booze! I'm not sure why they would put a Courtyard and a Residence Inn next to each other. I certainly would choose the Residence Inn if I had to choose between the two. Seems like Marriott has too many niches.\",\n",
       " 'We spent 3 nights at this hotel and were very pleased with the overall cleanliness of the hotel. Moreover the staff went out of their way to assist us in many ways.It is connected to a Courtyard and the restaurant there was excellent, with friendly, prompt service.Although it is located close to the Trudeau Airport and Autoroute 40, the soundproofing is excellent and we were never bothered by noise.Highly recommended as a convenient alternative to staying downtown.',\n",
       " 'Only in Mtl for the weekend - we only stayed one night and were pleasantly surprised. Ultra clean - the bathroom was the cleanest bathroom I have ever seen - Our room was beautiful - nicely decorated and also exceptionally clean. Everything was in great shape. The hotel was quiet and the staff pleasant. This hotel is close to the Airport and is in an industrial area, however, there were restaurants within walking distance and Cote Vertu shopping centre is close by as well. Our rate was $122 and the value was amazing. Absolutely nothing negative to say - it was all great.',\n",
       " 'We were traveling with two young adult sons to visit family in the area during Christmas vacation and chose this hotel because it offered the extra space and privacy we needed while being conveniently located between family members living in the city and on the West Island. We had a great stay. We arrived after a long drive on the Tuesday after Christmas and enjoyed a ( free!) light dinner of soup and delicious and nicely presented sandwiches, just what we needed at that point. The hotel is conveniently located near the Dorval (aka Pierre Trudeau) airport and close to major highways, but despite the plane and car traffic nearby, it was exceptionally quiet; great soundproofing in this new (2006) hotel! Several stores, restaurants, even a cinema complex, were within easy and safe walking distance from the hotel, and downtown Montreal was quickly and easily accessible by car. Everything was clean and fresh, the staff was friendly and helpful, and we would not hesitate to stay here again.',\n",
       " 'My husband and I stayed at Residence Inn Montreal Airport for four nights last week, while attending the Presidents Cup. I pondered whether we had made a mistake by not booking in Old Montreal, as we appreciate hotels with character, but any concerns quickly disappeared as soon as we walked into the lobby. The hotel is extremely clean, the accommodations very nice, and there is a &quot;boutique-y&quot; feel to the place. We were very tired after being at the golf tournament all day Saturday and Sunday, so we picked up wines, cheeses, sausage, etc at a local market and ate in the room while watching a movie. We spent Monday at Atwater Market, in Old Montreal, and in Little Italy, and Tuesday we drove to the Laurentides to see the leaves. As we were leaving Montreal Tuesday evening, we realized that we actually felt more central to things from this location, and we would not hesitate to make this our hotel of choice the next time we visit Montreal.',\n",
       " 'I chose this hotel as I was able to book several nights using my remaining Marriott Reward points. This hotel was very nice and clean. The rooms were very comfortable (beware - the mattresses are VERY firm). Breakfast had several options, and we were very pleased. We took cabs to the nearby Metro station to get into downtown Montreal. We found the Metro to be a great way to get around the city. There is a movie theatre and several restaurants in the area for things to do that are in walking distance.',\n",
       " 'As a mother of twins, a great quiet suite was very important to us. Brought the 5mo olds up to visit in-laws. The check-in was smooth. We left and visited family. When we returned we were informed that there was no electricity in any of the hotel rooms, only the common areas. The nice front desk staff gave us two flashlights. One of the main reasons we booked a suite was so that we could have the bassinet in a separate room and have access to a dishwasher. Needless to say, it was a very long night. The following morning I contacted to the front desk to find out how much of a discount we would receive I was informed that since the power outage was not their fault (hydro was doing repairs), they would not be issuing a discount.After the lights came back on, the rooms were very nice and the free breakfast was better than most-hash browns and french toast were on the menu.',\n",
       " \"Residence Inn just opened end of Aug 2006. We definitely recommend this hotel to anyone who is visiting Montreal with a car especially for families and individuals who need extended stay facilities for their spacious rooms fully equipped with a kitchenette &amp; dinette. The kitchenette had a stove top range, fridge, microwave, dishwasher, coffee maker, china and cutlery. I'm sure I would miss listing some other appliances, but in general I believe that this had more appliances than a standard Residence Inn (I have only been to 3 in total). . We were in a studio with a king sized bed and a queen or twin sized sofa bed. It was comfortable for our family of 3 adults and one child. It was our first visit to Montreal and wanted a room in downtown. However, after comparing prices, not to mention, additional costs for hotel parking (average of $ 18/day) downtown and a lot of bad reviews on mid-level hotels, we decided staying in this airport hotel. It was a pleasant surprise to find out that it was just 10 minutes (off-peak) to 40 minutes (peak) to downtown. Walking distance was a shopping complex with cinemas and restos. A complimentary hot and cold breakfast buffet was so filling that we had lunch at 3pm later in the day. This is versus the 1 croissant and a cup of OJ I have read on other downtown hotel reviews. I also read that most downtown hotels are old and had small rooms even for the mid-level brands. 'The staff was very friendly and helpful, nothing else we could have asked for. Other in-house facilities were an exercise room, heated pool and a kid's room. I am sure that there are other services and features that I would not be able to mention, but you definitely have to consider this hotel the next time you plan to go to Montreal. And I hope that the hotel's staff and management will continue to delivery excellent service or better! Residence Inn Montreal Airport - New, Very Comfortable, Spacious, Friendly, Great Value!\",\n",
       " \"My wife and I stayed at this hotel for 2 nights. This hotel is at an excellent location, right on Rue Sherbrooke Ouest (West). We found that the property was fairly new, and well maintained. All of the staff we encountered spoke French &amp; English, and happily switched between both based on our interaction. The rooms were extremely clean. Having free access to WiFi, as well as a microwave and refrigerator in the room were really helpful. The bathroom in *our* room did not have a tub (may be a concern for some - not an issue for us).Staying at this hotel will put you within walking distance of the Metro (Place-des-Arts), as well as restaurants/shopping (Rue. St. Catherine, etc). The hotel offers underground parking for $20 (CAD) a day. We didn't experience a problem finding a spot in their facility, and left the car there for the duration of our stay (walked and used the Metro). Overall, I was very pleased with our stay at this hotel. I have visited Montreal several times, and have stayed at a couple of other properties. We found a very good rate for this stay, and would certainly stay here again (if the price is right).\",\n",

The check in staff were lackluster and didn't recognize me as a Hilton Diamond though I did receive a breakfast chit which I didn't use. I was given what appeared to be a room for disabled persons and wasn't informed of it. With me you get one chance to get it right. I didn't complain I rarely do, I just don't come back. This place charges for everything that is gratis at most hotels including 1 disposable razor and for a plug adaptor. I think one can do much better for the money elsewhere in Montreal.\",\n",

And the room was nice, clean, modern, with comfortable beds and a very comfortable chair at the desk. Large, flat screen TV. Problem with shower's wate pressure/water heat was fixed after I asked. Use of the computers and printer in the business center was free. Only one laundry room that i saw, but I had no trouble getting access to the machine. The pool and exercise room areas were large and modern, with a decent view. The restaurant/bar area struck me as rather sterile, and often a bit &quot;dead,&quot; and also kind of pricey, but not outrageous (the bar and restaurant at the nearby Holiday Inn had a warmer atmosphere). Breakfast seemed the big meal of the day in the restaurant. The room had a refrigerator and microwave oven, and we used both. Front desk personnel were often, but not always, helpful in securing info about shopping, directions, etc. It was not much more than a 5-minute walk to the nearest Metro station. Convention center a bit over 10 minutes and Old Montreal maybe 20 (uphill coming back). We did see an occasonal person asking for money, but the statement about avoiding Bleury St. because one would be hassled by homeless people seemed like hyperbole. Overall, the hotel wasn't exceptionally warm or atmospheric, but clean, modern and adequate for most any traveler..\",\n",
       " \"This is a new Hilton and the hotel is in great shape. Service was excellent and more attentive than at most Hilton Garden Inns in the US. Parking is under the hotel and was about $20 CAD per night. It's on rue Sherbrooke and is in a good location for exploring Montreal. The block or two surrounding the hotel is nothing special but It's close to the dining on rue St. Laurent and just a couple of blocks from St. Catherine so it's easy to walk to most downtown attractions. Old Montreal is a little less convenient--walkable if the weather is OK, but otherwise a quick taxi ride. The hotel has a nice pool and hot tub on the 11th floor with a bit of a view and the fitness room, though small, had decent equipment in it. There's a bar and restaurant in the lobby. Didn't have dinner there, but the breakfast buffet was very good. We got a great deal on the room, so it was definitely worth it. Rooms were large and well decorated. Only quirk of the hotel was that the elevators required you to use your room key to activate them. This was only a mild annoyance--just remember to get multiple keys when you check in. Don't know why they do this. It's a perfect place for exploring Montreal. There's also a Marriott Courtyard next door.\",\n",

The Hotel was very clean and the staff made us feel right at home, hats off to Lisette at the front desk and Fausto the doorman. We had all our meals at the restaurant Circos which all were amazing first time in a hotel where we ate all our meals in the Hotel, the selection and quality exceeded our expectations.

The room was large and the bathroom was spacious, very clean and plenty of towels. As the weather closed in and it started to pour down we decided to eat in the hotels restaurant, it was very pricey, but we thought we'd treat ourselves. There were plenty of waiting staff and they were all very nice, but hadnt a clue what to do, they all stood around, fell over each other and the whole meal took almost 3 hours, we waited and waited and eventually got our 'fillet mignon' which was tiny and very over decorated, infact the meal looked a mess (what we english class as looking like a dogs dinner, i'm sure you understand that meaning!!??) it looked like a child had been let loose in the kitchen, we then waited 45 minutes for desert, which was pulled from a big catering box right by us, so much for home cooking! This was supposed to be fine dining??? McDonalds could have done better!!!! Needless to say we didnt eat there again. Also the hotel is a good half an hour away from the main river side sights, its close to the shops and a rather dodgy area down Bleury Street (dont go down even in the day you'll be hassled by homeless people).

       " \"This was the second time we have visited Montreal for a two-night mini-holiday as we love Montreal. After a lot of research online (love Trip Advisor!) we chose the Hilton Garden Inn. Being the Hilton name and not a cheap room, we expected a lot.First, the room itself was lovely, modern and very very clean. The staff were helpful (with one exception) and friendly. Location was also good as we love to explore the city on foot and using the Metro and got every where we wanted that way, including walking to the Old City.But being a Hilton and the cost we expect a polished experience. First, until I read a review submitted recently after we got back, I had no idea that you had a room choice of bath or shower (note the or, not an and). This needs to be far clearer online and elsewhere.We had a shower and although it was okay you had a choice, either good water pressure OR warmer water as the warmer you turned the tap the less pressure you received...Secondly, we are not much into nightlife and after along day of walking around we like to enjoy our evening in our comfortable suite (which we pay the extra to have for just that reason) and maybe watch a movie. Unfortunately the website is once again misleading and the channel selection is not what was expected, and we were very disappointed. This is also where the helpfulness did not shine as a call to reception about this (in case we just needed to do something different to get access) the day we arrived led to a promise that we would hear from the general manager as this was not what the website said was available. Well, we are now back home and still no call :-)And, finally, this one is just an example of how someone needs to pay attention to the details. The little pamphlet that you get your room access cards in clearly states that if you opt out of the daily paper, you can drop your room fee accordingly (by 75 cents, who cares) BUT yet the paper is not actually delivered to your door like a lot of hotels do. I don't get this one at all as we can't be alone in experiencing at the door delivery at other hotels. Come on Hilton.We didn't bring a car so have no comment on parking at the hotel etc.All in all we would recommend the hotel if the details don't concern you but as this is the second Hilton hotel family stay in Montreal that was lacking in the details, we will take a long look before we book at either of the Hilton's we have visited in Montreal in the future.\",\n",
       " \"We stayed here over the weekend, this Hilton was recommended by some friends. The property is located so centrally to so many things, shopping, movies, entertainment.

The restaurant had above average food and the staff was very welcoming and friendly. We will be back for sure!\",\n",
       " \"We are generally loyal Hilton Garden Inn customers, but this one just didn't make it for us. The room was too warm, and there really was no way to adjust the A/C to make things cooler. Beware: no bathtubs. Just shower stalls, so they told me. The lady of the house was not amused. And the plastic floor covering of the stall already had bubbled. The placement of the rail in the stall was not ideal either. The internet service was as slow as molasses in January (circa 1992), both in the business center and, even more pronounced, in the room. I was not amused. This could have been an anomaly, but I'm glad I wasn't there on business. We're diamond club members, so we received the complimentary breakfast buffet --- but that was a disappointment too, a surprise for Canada. We actually paid to eat somewhere else on the second day of our stay. The parking garage is fine, as long as you take it slow. The location is good for walking to Vieux-Montreal. We've seen worse for sure, we also expect a little more from this chain.\",\n",

The room was spacious and the bathroom was extremly clean. I had a lovely stay at the Hilton Garden Inn. It was a short 5min walk to the shopping area and a 15 minute walk to the nightlife on St-Denis and St-Laurent. It is not walking distance to the Old Port but a few metro stops away- in short, great location. The staff always had a smile. The room had a lovely view of the city and the Gym located at the top floor was clean and efficient along with a pool that families and kids enjoyed. The cardio equipment was basic but good enough to work out. There is also a nice patio with a great view of the city. I would definitely recommend and stay here again. Upon check out we had a slight problem with the charges per night for the room but it was quickly resolved with no fuss.\",\n",
       " \"After a lot of research and not being able to get a reservation at another hotel, I picked this hotel one the reviews and photos posted here. And, I'm happy I did - we loved it nad were very comfortable. We stayed 3 nights. Hotel is very very clean and new -- very important to me. The beds are super comfortable and rooms big enough - we had a room with 2 queens. Hotel location is good too -- you have to walk a bit to get to places but 15 to 20 minute walk is just fine. We loved it! We had breakfast in the hotel and it was excellent too.\",\n",
       " 'The service was great. The security was top notch (you even need to insert your card to get the elevator to work). The location was great. The rooms were clean and spacious. And of course, the pool/jacuzzi/patio area on the 11th floor was incredible! I would definitely recommend this hotel to anyone.',\n",
       " 'I recently visited Montreal with my family. We wanted to stay downtown but close to the old city and of course in a well-priced hotel. Besides the convenient location of this elegant, clean hotel, the customer service was impeccable, and the food fresh and delicious. To our surprise (but a pleasant one) they do not have the typical breakfast buffet - they only have a few items and the rest (eggs, omelettes, etc.) was prepared fresh and to our liking - but at buffet prices! The room was also extremely clean and tidy and everything in working order including a microwave oven which was ideal to warm up milk for our infant! The staff were extremely friendly AND knowledgeable. They helped us with everything from restaurant recommendations/reservations to sightseeing tips, guided tours, and shopping. They also sent us to pretty much the best coffee houses I have enjoyed outside of Europe. Finally, at the end of the day, we enjoyed a very quiet and relaxing room - we could barely believe we were downtown. Definitely staying here again!!! See you soon Montreal!!! Oh almost forgot...they have a salt water pool...',\n",
       " \"One of the attractions of staying at a Hilton is expecting a standard level of customer service and satisfaction. This hotel was beautiful, new and well kept, but the &quot;service&quot; provided by the staff and the management of this hotel fell well below Hilton standards.It's pretty basic to arrange wake up calls, but in this hotel, we only got one of the three arranged (not appreciated on the day of an early morning flight!). We reported minor maintenance issues in our rooms and they were not resolved until having to report them multiple times hours later. Basically, everything we spoke to the front desk and duty manager about went unresolved.Be very careful with your bill when you check out of this hotel. Do not charge anything from the bar/restaurant to your room or they will automatically add a 15% gratutity to your bill (although this practice is not posted anywhere and it comes as a surprise to the customer). They will also not be able to provide you with a breakdown/details of your restaurant/bar charges. According to the room key sleeve, they will deliver a newspaper to your room every morning, and if you refuse, they will credit your account the cost of the newspaper. Make sure you refuse this and get the credit, because even if you're a Hilton Honors member, they won't deliver any paper to your room. They don't deliver the paper to anyone.There are many good hotels in downtown Montreal. Too bad this one is such a major disappointment.\",\n",
       " 'I recently visited Montreal on a combination business / leisure trip.I normally stay at a long time favorite hotel on Sherbrooke St but it tired looking so I decided to try the Hilton Garden Inn nearby.Upon entering the hotel I was overwhelmed by the elegantly decorated atrium lobby with the beautifull ceiling fixture. Check in was efficient and I was in my room in 5 minutes. My room was spacious and tastefully decorated,the bathroom had all the aminities and large fluffy towels. My kids enjoyed the exercise room and the saltwater pool. At most hotels in downtown Montreal, you have to use valet parking,at inflated rates and gratuities. At this Hilton Garden inn ,I was able to park my large SUV without difficulty and at a reasonable cost. The staff was friendly ,polite and helpfull. I will stay at this hotel on my next trip to Montreal and would recommend this Hilton GardenInn to others.Ralph L.L',\n",
       " \"After going through the Trip Advisor reviews as well as other sites, we settled on The Hilton Garden in. Absolutely agree with those in favor of the hotel. The hotel staff from front desk to maids were always friendly and helpful with any questions posed to them. It is centrally located on busy Sherbrooke Ave, so you can get anywhere easily. Yet at night you don't hear anything that would disturb your sleep. One block from McGill Univ., so there is constantly pedestrian traffic of locals, tourists and college students. Rooms were all clean and comfortable. Parking under the hotel with no &quot;in-out&quot; limits as part of the daily fee. My only mild complaint is that though the beds are all large (kings or queens) they are quite firm even though they have an adjustable firmness dial on them. All in all, between the wonderful staff, ample sized pleasant rooms, parking and central location with the very reasonable price we were very happy with this choice. Trip Advisor reviews were right on again.\",\n",
       " 'Everything was great, we complain about the noise, because there was a construction nearby and they gave us 2 adjacent rooms instead of a suite which was kind of small (for 3 aldults and a 2year old) in the other part of the hotel where it was al quiet without any extracharge. Very clean and very happy to be there. Wed go back again',\n",
       " \"We stayed here with two teenage daughters during August and were very pleased. The room was larger than an average hotel room so we had plenty of space for the four of us. The room was clean and up to date. Our only complaint was that daily room service never seemed to get everything right. During our four day stay, we had to request additional towels and toilet paper several times. Hotel staff were prompt in handling these requests so it was only a minor inconvenience.We didn't eat at the hotel's restaurant but we did use the swimming pool and gym facilities - they were excellent. The view of Montreal from the rooftop pool and gym was great.The hotel's location couldn't have been better. There was a Metro stop a block away and we were within easy walking distance of Saint-Catherine's street for shopping. They were numerous cafes etc. in close proximity for morning breakfast.As noted in other reviews, the hotel seems secure due to the use of room cards to access the upper floors and facilities of the hotel.We will definitely stay here again if/when we return to Montreal. Of course, we could easily write another review on how much we enjoyed the city of Montreal.\",\n",
       " \"Stayed here for the weekend and had an amazing time. Staff was friendly and very eager to help. The hotel's location could not have been better -- 45 steps away from the metro and with the right shoes you can literally walk to the best spots. Walking distance to St. Catherine (commercial shopping center), St. Laurent (bars/restos/lounges). Amenities were great too, amazing pool and hot tub and a sunning patio too. Great for relaxation after a long day around the city.\",\n",

       " \"I picked this hotel because I was attending a conference at McGill, and I also was staying around for some vacation afterwards. I found this hotel a cut above most HGIs in the US. Because I'm a Gold member, I got upgraded to a sort of minisuite, a large room with a sort of dogleg with a sofa, armchair, TV, and kitchen. The dogleg was a little too small to relax in, but it made a nice buffer against noise in the corridor. All in all, it was a very quiet comfortable room (although I've been told that you want to avoid the rooms on the Sherbrooke Street side). The restaurant had better food and selection than your usual HGIs (it is hard to get a bad meal in Montreal, I found). Plus it is open late. But because it's an HGI, amenities such as wireless internet are free. The service in general was excellent. The hotel is also conveniently located in the central part of Montreal, within walking distance to McGill, downtown, great restaurants, and tourist attractions.The only downside is the parking, which is expensive and inconvenient, as the other reviewers have noted. We did not have any problem with the lot filling up, since August is apparently a slow time, but we found it cramped, with only room for one car at a time in the two-way lanes. It would help if the management painted a pedestrian walkway on the lower level ramps, since that is the only means pedestrians have of getting to higher level floors. However, we were able to live with the parking without any mishaps. Parking in general seems to be difficult in downtown Montreal, although otherwise driving is convenient (traffic not to bad, at least in August, well marked roads, abundant gas stations). If you can do without it, I'd recommend not getting a car.\",\n",
       " \"From the moment we walked in we LOVED this hotel!!!The staff was so helpful and extremly friendly :)We were thrilled with everything in this new hotel, the best parts would have to be:The rooms were huge and the beds were soooooo comfy and it doesn't stop there, the roof top pool and terrace were Amazing, we spent the whole day up on the terrace in the sunshine ;) Not to mention location just a few steps from all the shopping too!!I would highly reccommend this hotel, we will definatley be coming back again and again!\",\n",
       " 'We stayed here for two nights from 24 to 26 Jul 09. We made our reservation directly with the hotel on its website. For the price we paid (CAD$194.48/night plus $20/day for parking) , we expected breakfast to be included but was told when we got there, breakfast was an extra CAD$16/person. Check-in was fast and without any hassle. Parking was at the underground parking lot accessible by elevators. Security was very good as you need to use your room card key to use the elevators and to enter the parking lot. We were assigned a room on the 2nd floor with terrible view. The room was ordinary (2 queen-size beds, TV, fridge, microwave, coffee-maker, small bathroom). The bathtub was dirty though; there was dirt around the tub. We had our breakfast at the Cafe Circo at the lobby on the second day. It was a buffet with your choice of eggs/pancakes/bacon/sausage cooked to your liking. Cost for two adults was CAD$31.50. Our 4-year-old ate for free. We were not too impressed with the breakfast so decided to go a nearby Chez Cora the next day. The swimming pool, hot tub and fitness center are on the 11th floor, also accessible with the room card key. Location is excellent as it is just two blocks away from the main shopping district. Overall, it was an okay stay, but we would not stay there again because it is not good value for money. Wew ould try the Holiday Inn next door the next time we are in Montreal.',\n",
       " \"This hotel was wonderful! The bartender was willing to banter, the front desk was helpful, the concierge was so wonderful (and quite handsome). The hotel itself is located within walking distance of most of what you'll want to visit, provided you don't mind walking a little. There are maps available at the front desk. The swimming pool and jacuzzi were a nice relief at the end of a day of walking. Overall, a wonderful hotel with wonderful people.\",\n",
       " 'We stayed one night at the Hilton in February as were going by train and then using the Metro system. As it was February (cold) we found that the Hilton allowed you to travel to around Montreal without going outside. Staff were friendly and helpful and this may be the most secure hotel on Earth, you can only enter and exit by elevator, no street access. The downside was that our room was next to the heated pool and was very hot all the time.',\n",
       " \"My wife and I have stayed here twice in the last 12 months and will stay here again. The hotel is very clean, nice rooms and a very good location. Walk a few blocks and you have the metro, shopping (University/St. Catherine's) and restaurants (St. Laurent). The breakfast at the hotel is good. Best kept secret: the open veranda on the 11th floor -- perfect if you want to enjoy a good book and a great view.\",\n",
       " \"I stayed at this hotel for a week in July and have to say that I have never been so impressed by a hotel.I have to travel a lot in my line of work; therefore I have to stay in a lot of hotels.The stay was impeccable from the moment I first checked-in. After a delayed flight, I was greeted by a warm smile from the front desk clerk, who was not only sympathetic but I was amazed at how ALL of my special requests that I had made, through my online booking, were met. It was a delight to see how quickly I was served.During my stay, I often opted for the hotel restaurant and room service. The food is absolutely amazing but astonishingly well-priced as well and as usual served with a smile.The hotel services, from the gym (all new equipment), to the pool, location everything was beyond perfect.The rooms are perfectly decorated with a touch of coziness and modern sophistication. The hotel in its entirety is hands up the cleanness hotel I have ever been to.Everyone working in this hotel is very attentive to the guests' needs and does it with a genuine smile. Definitely a five-star hotel that I recommend without a moment's hesitation.\",\n",
       " \"We stayed at this hotel for 5 nights at the end of June. We are two parents and 2 teenagers so we booked a room with a suite (seperate door to a hide-a-bed). Checking in was simple. At first we thought we were on Candid Camera. We opened the hotel room door and walked into the hallway where there was a couch and tv...oh this must be a den...nope! This was what they called the junior suite part of the room. As a matter of fact - we had to totally move around the furniture in order for the pull out bed to pull out and still allow us access to the door!! Okay - so we had to move the furniture and it wasn't as big as we are used to......the shower was another episode of Candid Camera!! Everytime I turned on the shower the water barely came out. Each time a maintenance man came - of course the shower sprayed! Well it is a good thing I had a sense of humour cuz I was ready to go to the Salvation Army just to have a shower!! I finallyinsisted that the maintenance man take apart the shower and low and behold there was some plastic something that got into the pipes somehow at sometime during the renovations....blah blah blah...and they finally got it working. It still wasn't a great shower - but it was wet and warm.We bought the breakfast included option - but slept through it all but one day. There is a supermarket literally at the end of the block. There is a delicious creperie just at the corner too. The parking actually filled up one night and we had to beg and plead for them to help us find another option. They gave us the manager's spot. Oh we ordered room service one evening - the food came very quickly hot and yummy.The location is very good...Sherbrooke is a great street for easy access to Downtown, old Montreal, Six Flags, restaurants and shopping.We ate at Gibby's one night in Old Montreal with some friends who live in Montreal....Very expensive - but great service and super delicious!!!My parents and my sister's family stayed at Hotel du Fort in a suite and they were really happy.Hope this helps.Anyways, the staff, who are all really polite and friendly,\",\n",
       " 'I was there during a recent business trip to Montreal. I have to say that my selection of hotel could not have been better. From the time we were efficiently checked in, until final check-out, the hospitality of the staff was amazing. I spent the odd hour or so out people-watching on the patio while having a drink or two and I would be remiss in not mentioning the outstanding service of Max, the waiter. He was extremely service-oriented and friendly and was a great help with any questions I had regarding the surrounding area, nightlife and metro transit. Anytime I return to Montreal, I am guaranteed to stay at this establishment. I will also recommend them to whomever asks.',\n",
       " \"Travelled with a colleague to Montreal for the weekend and found out, to my silent delight, that my room and bathroom #1508 was much larger than his. Although we paid the same rate (CAD 180+++), I don't know the reason behind the discrepancy. Nonetheless, both rooms were clean and tastefully furnished. The chair at the desk was fully adjustable, and made working on my laptop much easier. I have been in many hotels where the chair is a standard upholstered chair and the height is really not suitable for business travellers. The bathroom (8'x10') was large and toiletries were by Neutrogena. Do note there is no bathtub. The Hotel provided a Get Fit Kit for free by request. This comprised of a medicine ball, 2 dumbells, a yoga mat, a resistance band, and some other exercise gear. Great for a workout in your own room! I took a peek at the gym and the small indoor pool and was not that enticed to use either.I did not have breakfast included in my room rate but did not have difficulty finding food around the hotel. There's a cafe in the basement of the building just a 3min walk away (turn left when you exit the hotel) that serves a decent eggs benedict and pancakes. There's a creperie (turn right when you exit, and it's on the corner) that had jars of nutella in the window! Very tempting... I ate at the lobby restaurant late one night and found the generous serving of smoked beef sandwich quite tasty. The chocolate souffle was a little too runny in the middle for my liking. Although the food was not outstanding, it was reasonably priced for a hotel restaurant. Location, as other reviewers have mentioned, is great. It's a short walk to the metro station and the concierge will call you a cab to the airport if needed. I'd stay here again and would recommend anyone to do the same!\",\n",
       " 'My husband and I stayed at this hotel on our recent trip to Montreal and loved it. We were upgraded to a suite, and the room was comfortable, spacious and well-appointed. The breakfast buffet includes a nice selection of breads, cereals and meats/cheeses and cook to order plates. As nice as the room was, the staff and the location helped make it truly wonderful. The concierge was fabulous! he had great tips for our sightseeing plans and arranged for a reliable cab to pick us up at 4 a.m. to take us to the train station. He was also just a lot of fun to talk to. The location was also wonderful. We never took a cab or public transportation while in Montreal. We were able to walk to everything we wanted to see. The hotel is centrally located between Old Town and shopping district. The view of the city from the rooftop terrace is also a plus. I would highly recommend Hotel Hilton Garden Inn!',\n",
       " 'We have stayed at this hotel twice now and on both occasions the rooms have been nice and clean and the staff extremely helpful. They communicate politely in both French and English. The breakfast is served in the typical Hilton Garden Inn Model with a buffet of continental breakfast foods and ordering of cooked breakfast and it is nice.It is only a 5 minute walk to the Metro and not too far to Rue St Catherine.',\n",

The hotel is about a ten minute walk from all of the city's action areas and had an excellent weekend rate.The food for breakfast was decent and th staff were helpful. We had a problem with our room (A/C not working) but this was soon sorted out and we were given another room and also free parking as a gesture of goodwill.

And the mattress was fantastic!!!',\n",

Bring a book, and spend some time up there..combined with the salt water pool..its breath taking!I was a bit pessimistic about the breakfeast buffet because I didnt see the traditional hot plates of runny scrambled eggs and potatoes, but after having my omlette made to order to my taste and then having the ultra friendly staff convince me to try their waffles also made freshly for me, I am afraid I wont be able to settle for less from now on.',\n",
       " \"Overall a nice stay and a little nicer than your typical Hilton Garden Inn. The only thing that wasn't that great was the breakfast. Also watch if you go to the pool...the pavement is extremely slippery. I'm almost fell walking to the hot tub. Also the pictures of the outside of the hotel are deceiving. The hotel is only about 11 stories high and the tall building next to it is condos I believe, but is has the Hilton Garden Inn sign on it. Nice place overall.\",\n",

We were happy with our choice, the hotel is clean and the staff was very friendly and helpful. We were concerned that it would be too far out of our way, but were happy that the hotel was within walking distance from St Catherine. The only thing I would mention is that their undergroung parking is somewhat confusing.. we had no problem getting in, but there is now exit sign, so we had to stop and ask someone.

       " \"The Good: The rooms were great! This hotel is only a year old and everything is up to date. The rooms are clean; beds are comfy, lots of space. The Hotel is very clean and well maintained. The bad:Parking: This is by far the worst parking garage EVER! It's very tight and only 1 lane with 4 floors of parking. We had a difficult time finding a spot, and then when we did we couldn't find how to get into the hotel. There is no signs telling you where to go, then when we found how to get up it was stairs. This is fine when you don't have luggage to carry up, the only other option would be to go up the parking ramps which are steep and you have a chance of getting hit by a car. This was not thought out at all when designing this hotel. I found the Staff at the front desk had no idea what was going on and rude. They charged items to our room that we didn't get, our key card would stop working after one use and the staff wouldn't believe you when you went back down to get it re programmed. I'm fluent in French but I speak English as my main language and the staff not thinking you can speak French would speak about you and other guests in French right in front of you. All in all the hotel was awesome, but parking and staff horrible!\",\n",
       " \"I reached Hilton Diamond VIP status last year, and have stayed in many HGI properties across North America. This is one of the nicest I've been to - unfortunately we had a very bad experience there...We were traveling with our baby, and just checked out of a different hotel because they had starting painting outside our door. When I called to make the reservation, I was assured that there would be no painting, renovation work or construction happening during our stay. We booked a 1br suite that was spacious and clean. The service was also terrific up to this point. However, the next day they started painting the hotel stairwell with extremely smelly and toxic paint. It was impossible to stay in our room for even a few minutes as the smell was burning our nostrils. The air conditioning system was also shut down for most of the day for service. We had to leave immediately. The hotel management ultimately did the right thing by us, but not without a lot of loud complaining.All this being said, I wold probably stay at this hotel again if I couldn't book into something better (Crystal!). The pool and fitness area are particularly nice.\",\n",
       " 'This hotel was simply great!! Living in Vermont, Montreal is a city we visit several times a year for leisure. Out of the over 15 hotels we have stayed at over the years, this one is simply the best! Kristine at the front desk was wonderful..super quick check-in! The cleanliness of this hotel was just spectacular! The room was beyond spacious and you must check out the pool, hot tub and sundeck, even if not planning on using it, its worth a quick peek just for the view alone. The gym and steam room were state of the art. My only small complaint would be that those huge fabulous windows we enjoyed upon arrival would have been even better with black out shades and not just the thinner, shear curtain that allows a ton of light in the early am. Easy fix with an eye mask! This hotel is by far the best Hilton we have ever stayed at anywhere!',\n",

Amazingly clean and spacious rooms, incredibly friendly and helpful staff and great location; all that we could ever ask for and more! There is also a Cora's steps from the hotel so that was a BIG plus for us! There was also a fantastic bistro on the SE corner of Sherbrooke and Bleury with an owner who was one of the nicest people that we have ever met! This hotel is HIGHLY recommended!\",\n",

Check in and forget the hassles... focus on what's important.\",\n",
       " \"Normally I find that Hilton properties tend to be overrated. Understandably, during a UFC weekend in Montreal the prices were inflated but the price of this Hilton was surprisingly competetive compared to other hotels in the area but on a non-event weekend even in the summer it's cheap at $120/night. The location is excellent walking distance to both St. Laurent and St. Catherine's so for nightlife and eating purposes it's great. The service was amazing. I made the mistake of booking a 1king bd instead of the 2-queen I intended. This is one of the few that actually has 2 queens in the room by the way. After realizing the mishap, we went back to the front desk and they were able to find a room to accommodate us with no extra charge. Room was simple but really clean with great comfy sheets and an amazingly comfortable bed. Us girls had a great sleep. I work for public health in Toronto so I'm very cautious about hotels and its cleanliness. This location was very well kept. Security was amazing as well as you need to swipe your room card in order to access the elevators, the parking garage and pretty much virtually every part of the hotel. The staff really make everything easy for their patrons. I highly recommend it.\",\n",

       " \"Stayed here for one night while on business, and was pleasantly surprised by the size of the rooms. Was supposed to stay in a suite on the 11th floor (according to my Hilton Honors preferences), but at check-in was told there was a construction elevator outside my window. I was given the option of looking at the room first, and indeed, the elevator was literally on the other side of the room window. I was not comfortable with this, and within 10 minutes, another room was found. Although the new room was not a suite, it was plenty big enough for my needs, with a great working area - comfy desk chair and plenty of light. Also, the bathroom was huge, with a big shower stall. The fitness centre had new equipment. I took a quick look at the pool, which also seemed nice.This is a more basic version of the Hilton brand, meaning no room service in the morning. The buffet breakfast was OK - not the best I've had, but it served the purpose.As I was there for work, I can't really comment on the neighbourhood, though it did seem a bit far east of the core, and hence may not be the best for shopping, etc. Also not sure of proximity to Metro stations.\",\n",

Free wireless internet in the hotel.Bathroom was clean, good shower head, new towels.There is an indoor pool, spa and gym on the top level. The pool was a little chilly for my liking but the spa was great after a long day. We ordered room service twice and both times were pleasantly surprised. Service was fast, food tasted great and had a decent price tag as far as room service goes. The location was good, very close to a metro station and grocery store. Everything was clean &amp; modern in the hotel and staff were very friendly and accomodating. I would recommend this hotel to other travellers to Montreal.

Old Montreal is close by metro or cab ride.Rooms are decent size, bright, clean, new, and the beds are really comfortable. Daily housekeeping was efficient and did a great job. Microwaves, fridges and coffee makers in each room were a nice touch.The staff is friendly and helpful. The food and the restaurant is good and room service very reasonable. The fitness centre has about 8 cardio machines, weight machines and free weights, plus a pool, hot tub, and steam room.

And then getting a good rate through Expedia clinched the deal.The staff was very helpful even offering a loan umbrella due to the rain outside. The room was very nice and clean. The beds were comfortable. The bathrooms were well stocked. Very much as desribed. Only one comment to add that may not be too flattering. I felt blindsided by the fact that I got a bill the next morning for $23 for parking in the garage. And that we got a $30 bill for breakfast when whe thought it was complimentary.

In addtion to having a good quantity and quality of workout equipment, the fitness room and pool are on the 11th floor and have large windows, making for an attractive space.The business center has two computers, which is adequate and internet access is at no extra charge. The staff is very helpful and efficient and clearly eager to make a good impression and all were fluent in English ( I assume they are fluent in French also and I heard one speaking German, but since I don't know those languages, I can't comment on the fluency of the staff in them).As usual at most Hilton Garden Inns, there is a not a full service restaurant, but room service is offered and there is a small bar. A full breakfast buffett is offered, including made to order omlettes. This was quite good. The location is in a pleasant residential area near McGill University, so there are plenty of restaurants, bars, stores and services nearby. The Place-Des-Arts Metro station is two blocks away. It is not in Old Montreal nor in the heart of the business district, but it is easy to get to both by Metro, taxi or on foot. The only real disadvantage of the location is that it is not connected to the underground walkway system. There are several other hotels nearby including a Courtyard, Holiday Inn, Detla and Four Points, but it is unlikely that any are superior to this property.\",\n",

       " \"I stayed at the YWCA Hotel Montreal. (They run a hostel too). It's got a great location for visiting Downtown Montreal, and even Vieux Montreal, if you don't mind the walk (almost 30 min, but lots of sights). You can walk to a variety of different restaurants at night. The rooms are clean and basic, and service is good. There is a restaurant in the lobby (breakfast is not included). The rates are fantastic for a big city--and the proceeds support YWCA programs, so that is a nice bonus. It's a quiet hotel and they have lots of tourist information and can help with anything you ask. The restaurant for breakfast is okay. Oh, if you stay out past 11, they lock the doors and you have to ring a bell to get in, FYI. Great stay on a budget, in the heart of the city.\",\n",
       " \"We stayed in this hotel in Montreal for one night. We had one of the cheap rooms with shared bathroom. The room was clean with a TV and air conditioning. It was comfortable but not attractive. We were happy with the room for the price. The one real problem is with the bathroom and shower facilities. There's no problem with this as far as the ladies are concerned, but for men things are much more grim. The men's bathroom is dark and dirty, and you should be prepared to wait for your turn almost every time you visit. The shower room is a little better, but it too gets messy quickly. Here's my top tip: if you get fed up with waiting for the bathroom (and, eventually, you will), there's another one on the ground floor. It's the only additional one I could find. Or even better: pay a little more and go for a room with a private bathroom! Or even better than that: forget about staying in a hotel and book into one of the many good B&amp;Bs in Montreal for the same price!\",\n",
       " \"I stayed a couple of days in Hilton, Quebec City for business prior to traveling to Montreal. This was a side trip and I didn't want to spend too much money, so I booked the Y hotel with not much expectation since I paid about $60 per night only. It turned out to be a pleasant experience. The facility is old and cannot be compared to Hilton but the room is almost as spacious as the 4 star hotel I stayed previously. The kitchen facility is a great bonus even though I didn't really use it. My guest visitors were also very impressed when they came to visit me.\",\n",

There's a metro stop a few blocks away. The room that I stayed had a private bath. It looks like that the hotel is recently rennovated. Everything looks new! Both the room and the bathroom were very cean and comfortable. (The room was very quie?.) There's a TV set in the room. Also an ice machine down the hall way. There are a microwave, pots, and pans in their kitchen (there's a supermarket just blocks away), where you could prepare your meals. The kitchen is clean and has lots of sun light. (Also free use of the YMCA gym)The only downside is that there's no wireless internet access inside the hotel.\",\n",
       " \"I was excited to stay at the Ritz for the first time, but it was really dated. Old floral curtains that matched the floral bedding. The room was small and looked like it was stuck in 1930 during the depression. However, my husband just loved the Bulgari toiletries that they gave each guest. The location was fine and we found street parking which was good. The lobby is really pretty and posh though. It's a bit deceiving though since the room we got was so small, old, worn and dated. However, even though it was the Ritz, we got a great price on Orbitz at around $140 a night (or perhaps it was even less). It was nice to at least try the place out. The staff was very friendly and professional at check in. The only complaint again was the dated room.\",\n",
       " 'The Ritz is definitely a beautiful old hotel but in sore need of some renovations and updating. For a hotel in the middle of downtown, why is there no wifi? They do have a connected option, however, that costs extra - about $10/day. Boo.We enjoyed the Bulgari toiletries, the impeccable service and warmth; the location  very convenient  about 1.5 blocks away from the Metro, a few skips from numerous banks, steps away from the amazing Musee des Beaux Artes, a good, flat, meandering walk to Chinatown and Old Town and a bit of a hike up to the Plateau du Mont Royal.',\n",

       " 'The standard room we had was spacious but the mattress a bit soft. A knob came off the closet which made the closet door hard to operate. From the scratches it appears the knob had been reattached many times but just comes loose just as many times.  Breakfast which was included was average with croissants, jams and such. The setting overlooked a pond with swans but the whole thing looked tacky-- scale wrong, swans unhappy, wire fences... yuks. The location of the hotel was further away from the University and scene of action than many other cheaper hotels but this meant it is easier to find parking although valet service was included.  All in all this is a worn around the edges property that believes it is a 5 star property. But nothing in its amenities justifies that self delusion. At most it is a 3 star property.',\n",
       " \"Stayed at the hotel 2 nights. Old hotel in classic building, but in strong need of renovation - public areas are dated and lobby area have dirty carpets. Room was OK, but you expect more of a 5 star hotel. I've travelled for more than 20 years on business, and if it wasn't because of the name, one would rate this as a 3 star hotel. If you expect luxury and 5 star hotel feeling, then don't go there - if you want a central located hotel, then it's OK.\",\n",
       " 'Decided to book a room through hotwire to spend a romantic night in Montreal during the week (we live on the South Shore). We were very excited when we foud out that we were going to the Ritz. The Hotel and the lobby were extremely nice and elegant but the rooms very disapointing. Rooms were clean but clearly need to be renovated. The tub and toilet are pink... (dating from 30 years ago). The bed was not that comfortable. Location is perfect is you are visiting Montreal and want to be close to the action, everything is walking distance or you can take the Metro. Parking is 30$/day which is way too expensive!!!. We stayed at the Intercontinental before which was much nicer.',\n",
       " 'We stayed here for a couple of nights in Feb 2008.First the good ..... We enjoyed the location which is very close to the main shopping areas. It is also very handy for the Metro. Although we had a few issues with the room (see the bad points below) we did - in general - like it. It was large, spacious and comfortable. The bed was one of the softest I have ever slept on - very nice. The staff were also very friendly.Now for the bad ..... Although the room was comfortable, the decor was &quot;tatty&quot; and the room smelled of vanilla from the Glade Plugin that was turned up full behind the chair. However, the most noticeable thing for me was the lack of a kettle in the room. Most hotels give you a kettle, a few cookies and the chance to make your own cuppa in the morning or evening. The Ritz-Carlton, it seems would prefer you to order a $6 room service one. We compromised and walked to the Second Cup a couple of blocks away !Bottom line - So long as the room rates were suitably economical we would stay here again as the good points outweighed the bad ones.',\n",
       " 'I have stayed at the Ritz Montreal many times for business and experience always the same so I felt I needed to finally pass them along!! 1. poor plumbing (faucets never work in the shower-changed rooms twice). bathtub almost overflowed, I could not get it turned off.2. bad smell in rooms! well great, if you love the smell of &quot;fabreeze&quot; room spray (so strong it was overwhelming)3. room service slow, expensive -not great food 4. bed hard as a rock 5. air extremely dry!!! 6. bad lightingFront desk staff always nice as with concierge but for someone looking at a nice room with the luxury touch this is not the place. I recommend the Vogue around the corner.',\n",
       " 'Upon entering the Ritz Carlton Montreal, its easy to imagine how grand this place once was. Today, its a shadow of its former self - but not an entirely unappealing shadow. The physical plant still remains grand at its core, but with the most recent renovation almost twenty years ago, furniture scuffs, wall cracks, and outdated heating systems abound. Our room was a deluxe room and was large and clean with a beautiful crystal chandelier and a functional grey marble bathroom (the marble clearly thrown up over what is a barebones hotel bathroom). The old marble fireplace in the bedroom had rather unceremoniously been boarded up and while the sheets were of the highest quality, the pillows and furniture was cheap and showed its age. The heat for the room was controlled by three separately controlled units stuck into each window. They must have served as airplane engines in their former lives based on their noise levels. The walls were thin and we were woken up by our neighbors alarm clock and television. Service remains competent but obviously strained. One desk clerk, one concierge, and a doorman were all I saw. The concierge also tried to direct us to what clearly turned out to be tourist traps that he had a personal relationship with. We didnt eat in the dining room, but we did have a cocktail at the Ritz Bar which is the product of an awful renovation. Imagine taking the bar from an average airport hotel and stuffing it into the lobby of the Plaza. They also only had two red wines by the glass  certainly not the Ritz Bar that many reviews claim to have live piano music and nightly dancing. The Palm Court had two palms and the once grand fireplace had been reduced to a cheap looking gas unit. All of these comments must be balanced against the fact that the hotel is now unbelievably inexpensive ($150 a night during our weekend). Plans are underway to close the hotel and restore it to its former glory. I look forward to a return when that has happened since the grande dames fundamentals still remain strong, even in her diminished state.',\n",
       " \"For 60 years, The Ritz-Carlton Montreal was the best hotel in the city. Then the Four Seasons opened, and the Ritz had real competition for the first time. Thirty years later, the Four Seasons is no longer a Four Seasons (first a Westin, and now an Omni) and some would argue, The Ritz-Carlton is not much of a Ritz-Carlton anymore. I think that is a bit harsh. While this Ritz is not a part of the Ritz-Carlton chain any longer. . .it was for awhile. . .this hotel was the first Ritz-Carlton in North America, even pre-dating the Ritz in Boston (also no longer part of the Ritz-Carlton chain). In short, a great bit of hotel history and a Montreal landmark of thousands of bar mitzvahs and weddings.What the hotel is today is a bit faded albeit well maintained, but still quite gracious and possessing the best westside location in Montreal--Holt Renfrew is next door, The Musee des Beaux Arts is nearby, and Mont Royal is just steps away. I found the service professional and thorough, if a bit stiff, though if this hotel is no longer a real Ritz, no one told the staff.The hallways are wide, bright and very Ritz-Carlton, with the rooms solid and a throwback to another era. My room, while not large, was spacious enough, with crown moldings, high ceilings, a chandelier, expensive sheets, and a rather thoughtful foyer with a double door to keep hallway noise out. I'm sure the bathroom was among the most elegant in the city in 1969 when it was likely last renovated, but the shower is great, the walls lined in marble, the amenities are from Bulgari, and there is both a phone and a shaving mirror. The bed was a bit more firm than I like, and the armoire was scuffed--if you seek wireless internet, flat screen TVs, or other technology, keep looking. Dated and faded it is, but it is nearly Parisian in its elegance, and singular in its romantic charms.Lobby, public spaces and famed restaurant are still elegant--though food and beverage are notably expensive. Better to grab a noteworthy steak frites at L'Entrecote de St. Jean, a few blocks away on Peel. . .For those seeking exercise while staying here, the hotel has a small exercise room--two treadmills, two bikes--but furnishes free passes to MAAA which is a swank health club three blocks away. Sounds great, though in bitter winter weather, it is less attractive than it might appear at first, given the walk.Disclaimer here--I got this hotel for $75 a night on Hotwire, which is a tremendous bargain. By contrast, a room at The Ritz-Carlton New York is $595 a night, and just the tax on that amount is more than the room in Montreal. So it is not as nice as the Manhattan hotel, but certainly is a noteworthy bargain by comparison. There are extensive plans to renovate and add onto this hotel into a condo/hotel complex. Until those plans are conclusive, The Ritz in Montreal proves a great bargain, an interesting slice of Montreal's history, and a wonderful base from which to discover one of North America's most exciting cities.\",\n",
       " \"Stayed at the Ritz in downtown Montreal, a few blocks from the Peel metro station which was convenient. Service at the hotel was fine (had no complaints or really any needs to test any real service needs though). I was able to check in early as the room was ready and was able to leave bags at the hotel to pick up later on in the day for an evening flight. Room service does appear to come early as someone else noted--around 8:15am--but leaving the privacy sign on the door solves that issue if you aren't up and out early morning. Room size is good, amenities fine as well.\",\n",
       " 'We stayed three days around new years and enjoyed our stay. The hotel is a great old classy Montreal hotel in a great location, but it is showing its age a bit. It will be closed and renovated at some point in the future, but for now it is a very good hotel, but just not the over the top service you would expect at the Ritz. Hallways are wide, rooms are large and spotless, bathroom fixtures are clean but old. If you get a rate of around $200, you will be very satisfied with the value received. For breakfast, I highly recommend Eggspectation around the corner on Montage and Maissoneuve.',\n",
       " 'this is a beautiful hotel - it feels like old europe- very very comfortable beds- however the food is awful and way too expensive',\n",
       " \"The hotel is an old, charming hotel. This was our first time to Montreal - worst snow since the 70's and had a blast. This hotel was a steal on Travelocity which included the airfare. Based on purchasing airfare separately I would venture to guess we paid just over $120.00US for each nights stay. For a comparable hotel in Manhattan it would be about $600+ US.The entrance is very charming and the location of the hotel is great. I would take the advice from another reviewer and say that you should walk up one to two blocks to find great restaurants. While there are restaurants from within a stones throw, these tend to be geared toward the business/office worker on lunch break. Not awful restaurants, but not impressed.The restaurant at the hotel was most of the time empty, but we found the food very very good and well-prepared. The towels were a bit thin, but would be considered medium thickness. I just expected more from a Ritz.The general service there was excellent. I have never stayed at a hotel where in service food was brought to the room - consistently - within 30 minutes of ordering. In-service food was very good.The beds were above average, the bathroom was clean and the maid staff were very good. One reviewer says, and we agree, to consistently hang the &quot;Do Not Disturb&quot; sign outside of the door. Otherwise, it seems that someone was knocking (stock the refridge, maid, etc.) more than most hotels we have been. I chalk this up to very good, but almost too diligent service.The bar there seems like an afterthought, but overall we would most certainly styay there again - especially at that price. To have fun, a drin, whatever - just walk across the street to the Sofitel\",\n",
       " 'We stayed at the Ritz-Carlton for 2 nights after making the reservation on expedia.com. We were torn between this hotel and staying at the Fairmont Queen Elizabeth since the rates and standards are supposedly comparable, but decided on the Ritz because of its location. With taxes, our bill for just the rooms came out to $324 for the 2 nights, and because we parked (valet only), we were charged another $60.I read up on the hotel before our stay and learned that this hotel is no longer part of the Ritz-Carlton chain of hotels and has only kept its name. We went in with no expectations, though judging from the other guests at the hotel, they expected this place to still be the hoity-toity hotel that it probably once was. Every guest we encountered gave us a snooty look and most were well into their 50s or 60s. I felt like we were the youngest guests there and though we were treated respectfully when we checked in and out, not once did the front desk or concierge acknowledge us when we walked through the lobby and never did the doorman open the door for us, even as we walked directly up to him.The hotel has a pretty old fashion feel to it and has very traditional dcor. The hallways are long and smell like really strong perfume or potpourri. We stayed in a standard room, which was a good size with a small foyer and bathroom separate from the bedroom by a hallway. Our window looked out onto Sherbrooke Street and let in a lot of light during the day. We checked in late at night and were pleasantly surprised to walk into a perfectly warm room. The heating system works well to maintain the temperature, but it is a bit loud being so close to the bed and I was woken up by it a few times in the night.The bathroom is in some serious need of updating. I actually laughed when I turned on the lights. The bathroom is completely beige: beige taupe tiles on the walls, beige sink, toilet and bathtub. Its a decent size, but the floor was a bit cold and I was a bit surprised that they wouldnt have a bath mat. Because of the colour, the bathroom felt a bit grimy, but it was in fact quite clean, which is really important for me when judging hotels. The hot water pressure was a bit low, but now Im just getting nit-picky. The shower pressure was decent and the toiletries are Bvlgari. Their towels still have the Ritz-Carlton logo, but they mustve been pretty used because they felt heavily starched and crunchy.We used the hotels business centre, which consists of 2 computers and a printer. We were happy not to have to pay to use the internet and the centre is open 24 hours a day. The valet parking was very speedy, and so was the bellman who brought us our bags (it was 1am). Overall, we would stay here again for the right price. Ive stayed at other hotels in Montreal and the rate is competitive, especially considering the level of cleanliness and the king size bed with high thread-count sheets! The location is ideal and at least the employees werent flat out rude to our face. If I had a bigger budget though, I would opt for Loews',\n",
       " \"Normally my husband and I choose boutique or locally-run hotels over international chains, but we got a great last-minute deal on the Ritz Montreal so we decided to take it.Overall I would say it was very good to excellent. Previous reviews are correct--it's a historical hotel, not a hyper-modern one, so don't expect brand-spanking-new. The lobby is lovely, service was excellent, and the room was spotlessly clean and nicely appointed.Much like any hotel in this category, they really screw you on the extras. Don't bother with breakfast--you can do better at nearby Eggspectations for a big breakfast or much cheaper at any of the many downtown coffee shops for a coffee and pastry. The bathroom was probably the part that showed the most age, but it was by no means unpleasant. It just didn't look like it had been recently refurbished. It was very clean, and the toiletries were high-quality. Nice bathrobes, too.I would certainly stay at the Ritz again if I got a bargain. It's well-located (near the Metro, underground city, McGill campus, many restaurants, museums) and quite nice.A hint (not related to the Ritz): Don't bother with the Aerobus service to/from the airport. It's very unreliable, and we might have missed our flight if we'd sat around waiting for the Aerobus to arrive. It's supposed to come every half hour (not to the Ritz, but to a nearby hotel), but we waited for about 50 minutes and none showed up. We ended up taking a taxi. It's more expensive but worth it for the convenience and reliability.\",\n",

We needed to get up early for the race, so quiet and comfort were most important. They put us on the busy street side so we heard traffic all night. At 2:30 am a very loud crowd entered the room next to us and kept us awake until 4:30 am. We called the front desk and were told they would send up security. After security asked them to quiet down once these guests continued to be loud. The walls are paper thin and we could here they &quot;shushing&quot; each other as well as their conversation. The next morning when asked about our stay we informed the manager of our 3 hour night sleep. She apologized and said that she would allow us to check out late and mentioned that something extra would be offered to us at the brunch we were having at their restaurant. Nothing extra was given to us and we were locked out of our rooms after check out time. This place is not what you would expect from a Ritz-Carlton. Also, the bed was as hard a rock. The brunch was nice, but very expensive. Do not stay here if you want peace and quiet!',\n",

I can say that I couldn't be happier with my stay...it was by far the best hotel experience I've ever had. Jose, the doorman of 23 years, was a delight and very personable. Pierre, the concierge, was more than happy to assist me and he was a total pleasure. The rooms were roomy and the beds were made so well that I hated to leave them each day...I felt I was sleeping on a cloud. The housekeeping staff were pleasant and very attentive. The location was idea, just a short walk up to Parc du Mont Royal, a block away from the Musee of Beaux Arts, and a safe and bustling neighborhood of shops. They provide high end sundries and luxurious towels/robes. From what I understand, the hotel is going to close down to undergo several renovation projects at the end of this year so I'd suggest everyone get their trips to Montreal in soon as I'm sure the price will more than likely skyrocket once renovations are complete. (I stayed in what I consider this 4+ star hotel for $140/night. Unheard of! I fear I won't be able to afford it on my next visit and now I am spoiled!)\",\n",

       " \"In looking for rooms in Montreal for a 4 night stay - the Ritz-Carlton is one of the best deals going in the city. This hotel is a delight and with what is really a transparant transition in ownership - this hotel is offering some great deals right now. I disagree with other reviewer comments - I believe the location of this hotel is just about perfect - as it gives you access to some of Montreal's best sites.This Ritz-Carlton is the first in North America and as it is a old property there is some wear and tear on the property (some wear on rugs and general age) I believe this hotel is a solid 4 star property but not the 5 star variety that may be seen in other cities.The rooms are exceptionally comfortable. The bed was nice (albeit too soft for me) and the room offered a spacious closet (perhaps the largest I have seen in any hotel) and the room included an umbrella and a bathrobe. The bathroom was well equipped but it was evident by the fixtures that the bathrooms were older - but still nice. The shower offered hot water quickly and solid water pressure. A minibar was also offered in the room - though the prices were very high. The conceriege service was helpful. We had one meal at the hotel - a room service dinner - and it was delicious. Be prepared that prices are very high at this hotel for all meals. A number of cheaper dining options are within walking distance - so would only suggest eating at the hotel if you must.Key Montreal attractions are nearby - Mont Royal park, The Montreal Museum of Fine Arts is two blocks away, the McCord Museum at McGill University is walking distance, the Bell Centre Arena is 2-3 blocks away, and numerous shops. The subway can be picked up two blocks away. Overall, I strongly recommend the Ritz-Carlton Montreal - a real delight.\",\n",

We had a fabulous time. The staff was wonderful and we had breakfast in our room each morning. Service was prompt and friendly. The bed was lovely and comfortable. I was surprised to learn that the property has been sold. I hope this does continue to be a hotel. There was only one small glitch; when I looked at the advertisement for the package deal after we returned home, it said we should get three nights accommodation , breakfast each morning and valet parking; all of this we got, but it also list a &quot;gift&quot; for the summer festival. I thought I recalled a gift and I asked at the front desk twice, but no gift. Somebody goofed, but that was not enough to put a damper on our holiday in beautiful Montreal.

Our package included breakfast which we had sent to our room. The food was magnificent and special thanks to Luigi who was so very prompt, efficient and friendly in the morning. The front desk staff were helpful and every morning they found me a Globe and Mail. We didn't want to leave, imagining what it would be like to spend weeks on end being pampered. Simply the best hotel in Montreal. It is so close to the best shops (Holt Renfrew, Ogilvie's, Henry Mark Clothing) and the Montreal Museum of Fine Art.

Night room service very bad.This hotel is not a ritz-carlton any more, that's what they answered to me when i complained during the night.The girld told me sir, we are not a ritz carlton any more and stop compare.so you can see...................\",\n",
       " 'After reading the mixed reviews of this hotel, I was a bit hesitant to book. However, everything about my stay was wonderful. The room was clean and spacious. The bathroom was very charming with the marble sink and floor. The robes were warm and fluffy. The location was also perfect. The staff was all helpful and pleasant. Overall, this hotel was an excellent value and I would definitely stay again.',\n",
       " \"We go to Montreal quite often, most of the time in the winter when most of the wonderful hotels in Montreal can be had at great prices. For this trip we were just going to relax, shop and sip on a few adult beverages and didn't want to pay the $300 plus per night rate of most of the properties we usually stay at were charging. So I ventured over to Hotwire and they had a 3.5 star for $72 per night. When I found out it was the Ritz Carlton, I thought it must be a misprint, until I checked out the reviews. The hotel is not technically a Ritz Carlton any longer, though it maintains the logo etc. So going into this stay I wasn't expecting a typical Ritz Carlton experience, and given the rate we paid I shouldn't have. Here is my breakdown of the hotel;Pros:We found all the staff to be very friendlyLots of in room amenities (free safe, iron/iron board, robes, as well as all the standard amenities one would expect in a 3 star room or better)Very nice towels, and bvlgari toiletriesNice bedding, especially the sheets, and the mattress was quite comfortable although probably getting a little oldThe best part of this property (for us anyway) was the location. It is very near Mont Royal (for a great hike, and lovely views/photos), Crescent St (for the above mentioned adult beverages/nightlife, and close to all the shopping on St. Catherine St. It is a little walk to Old Montreal, but we did the walk to the base of St Laurent in about 40 minutes.Cons:Standard rooms must be really small, I tipped the front desk $20, and she &quot;upgraded&quot; us to a &quot;larger&quot; corner room, room 935 (the hotel has 10 floors) they originally had us in room 315 and this upgraded room was still fairly small (less the 300 square feet)The decor though somewhat charming is starting to show its age, however I don't think a renovation is coming. The word on the street was the investors who purchased the property from Ritz Carlton are going to turn this hotel into lofts/appartments (this could of course be false)No pool, fitness room a little below averageThe biggest concern of this property is the soundproofing, or lack thereof. Even on the 9th floor, the street noise below was easily heard, and we also heard alot more from an amorous couple than we probably needed to. Also there are no drapes in the bathroom, just frosted glass, and the light flooded in the first morning (this was of course corrected by shutting the bathroom door following nights)All in all, given the price we paid we were very happy with our stay. The price, location, and staff more than made up for the somewhat decaying rooms. We probably wouldn't stay here again, simply because we have so many favourite hotels in Montreal, but if price were an issue again and we could get it for this rate again it wouldn't be the worst thing to happen.\",\n",
       " 'I booked our stay several months ago when we decided to visit Montreal during the Jazz Festival. At the time, most of the reviews of this hotel were good. Closer to our stay I rechecked the reviews and I became very concerned that the hotel may have deteriorated due to a change in hotel ownership. I am happy to report that the hotel was very nice. The rooms were very clean, the staff was friendly and helpful and the location was great (short cab ride from Old Town and the Jazz Fest).The outdoor garden dining room was lovely, we enjoyed the duck pond and garden. The service was friendly although at times a bit slow (we had breakfast there every day of our 5 day stay) and the food wasquite good.While this hotel shows its age a bit, it is very well priced. Overall, it was a wonderful experience.',\n",
       " \"We stayed at the Ritz-Carlton, Montreal last weekend as a getaway and to catch a bit of the jazz festival. We thought we'd try this hotel rather than stay at the Fairmont/Queen Elizabeth - our usual hotel. The deal was a good one - three nights with breakfast and parking for $599 Canadian - (which at the time was pretty much par with the American dollar. Most of our stay was really great - the room was clean, the towels fluffy and the housekeepers ever-present. The staff was friendly and helpful.We did have one problem - When making our reservation we expressly requested accommodations on a high floor so the street noise or any noise would be minimal - especially during the evening hours. Everything was fine until the evenings when we found out that the main ballroom (which was apparently located below our room) was booked for2 proms and a wedding - a function every night of our stay. We could hear the booming music in our room every evening. When we called the front desk the first two evenings, they apologized for the inconvenience and said that the functions would last only until 10 PM. This seemed reasonable and it wasn't until the third evening when the band was still blasting away at 11:30 PM, that we called the front desk again and asked for the Manager on duty - She also apologized for the noise and inconvenience and acknowledged that this was a known problem; in fact, it is a problem that the hotel management has been aware of for some time.When we asked what time the function was going to end, we were told that the ball room was booked until 3AM. We suggested that perhaps we could be moved to different accommodations,but she did not respond. She did say that she would ask the band's manager to lower the volume. Apparently, she was not very effective because we could still hear the music well into the A.M. hours - in fact, sometimes it even sounded louder. . Needless to say, we had very few hours of sleep that night. The next morning, while settling our bill at the front desk there was no mention of the noise or inconvenience to us. To make matters worse, we needed return home early so we needed to have breakfast at 7:30 AM. Both of our breakfasts were delayed and when they finally came, they were really poor - cold eggs and soggy pancakes. Our waiter informed us that the chef/cook forgot to turn on the griddle so it had not heated properly before the breakfast was prepared. To his credit, our waiter did apologize for the inconvenience and offered us another breakfast selection.We were disappointed in these experiences and needless to say, they really put a damper on our weekend - which was supposed to celebrate our 35th anniversary and my birthday.We have letters written to the CEO and General manager so we'll se what happens. My solution would be to stay there mid-week rather than the weekend!\",\n",
       " \"We stayed at the Ritz for 3 nights during the jazz fest. We'd read the reviews, and brought a &quot;noisemaker&quot; which gave us rain sounds to sleep by. The room was great - with plush towels and robes, great Bulgari bath shampoos &amp; soaps, as well as cheery service.We parked a block up in a public lot by the Moroccan restaurant, for half the rate of the hotel. We had a great time! We recommend croissants for breakfast at Nocochi at 2156 MacKay St. Jazz Fest rules!\",\n",
       " \"We picked up this hotel through Hotwire for only $79!Whilst the hotel is a Ritz Carlton, I believe it is only 3 1/2 stars now. The hotel does have beautiful classical furnishings, but some things do need a bit of an upgrade. Purely asthetics though.The bed and pillows were really comfortable. The room was huge and spotless. They even had some Bulgari toiletries in the bathroom!The front desk staff weren't as good or friendly as some hotels we've stayed at, but they weren't rude. We found the doorman went out of his way to help, to the point of extreme!The location was also pretty convenient Would definitely stay here again.\",\n",
       " \"First off, this hotel was sold by the Ritz in January 2007 and is no longer part of the Ritz chain. We found this out when we noticed that the lion logo in the hotel is different from those of the regular Ritz chain. As a part of the sales agreement, it was allowed to call itself just Ritz-Carlton Montreal and not &quot;The Ritz Carlton&quot;. The location is great but that's basically it. The hotel is beaten up inside and the amenities are average. I can see why the Ritz decided to sell this property and not overhaul it. There are a lot of other new boutique properties in Montreal that are better and where you get more bang for your buck. The horrible part is that the staff still tries to pass this property off as a Ritz when it isn't anymore.\",\n",
       " 'The hotel looks nice from the outside and it is in a great location. However, the inside was nothing special and there is no pool. Bring your own sodas and water as these items are rare and very expensive. Parking was also very expensive. There are less expensive parking lots within a few blocks of the hotel. The rooms were clean, but the walls are paper thin. You can hear everything in the next room. The staff was nice and they left fresh dates for us in our room. We enjoyed the dates, but thought it was an odd choice. If you do stay here, do not forget to try Reubens Restaurant at 888 St. Catherine W. It is a few blocks from the hotel and made our stay.',\n",
       " \"I stayed at the Ritz-Carlton for one night (weekend trip) in March, and had a very pleasant experience. As with most old-fashioned hotels, the lobby and public areas were gorgeous, and the rooms themselves were perfectly adequate, but nothing to write home about, really. Nice toiletries, spacious enough, a very comfortable king-sized bed. The concierge was incredibly helpful, and the staff in general made my stay very pleasant. I don't know that I would stay at the Ritz again simply because I'd rather stay in the Plateau area of Montreal - the Ritz is located in more of a business district. But it's very close to the Metro (Peel station), and so it's easy to get everywhere from here. If you can find a decent rate, I wouldn't hesitate to book a room here!\",\n",

       " \"have stayed at this hotel several times. it resembles the city of montreal in that it has seen better days. of course that in part is the charm of montreal ( its faded glory ). i stay at this hotel because of its location in the heart of the city. i prefer not to stay in old montreal. its way too touristy. one can stomach just so many t-shirt shops. the good...its clean and attractive in its mid-20th century way. the staff are friendly and accomodating with the notable exception of the often missing doorman. i've found though that a missing doorman is better than the normal rude obnoxious ones that often man the front. the prices are very inexpensive by ritz standards. also as i visit the city often in the summers the a/c is very good which is often not the case in many canadian hotels. also i might add that i had a medical emergency last summer while staying at this hotel and the staff was great. they had a doctor in my room within an hour ( it was not the type of condition that would warrant a hospital visit ). as i was unable to walk for several days i was so glad i was staying at this hotel. they were wonderful providing me with everything i needed. is this montreal's best hotel. no. is it in a great location, reasonably priced and staffed by wonderful people. yes.\",\n",
       " 'Our experience at the Ritz-Carlton Montreal was terribly disappointing. The rooms are old and the walls are thin. We had to complain about guests who were having a party across the hall. Hotel security was very slow to react and we were kept up most of the night. The towels and robes looked like the were 100 years old and felt like sandpaper. I will never stay there again. Definitely not worth the money. Stay at the Omni down the street-much nicer!',\n",
       " \"This is a lovely old style building with beautiful architectural highlights. The rooms have the original tall closet doors with 14 foot ceilings. The hall ways were a bit worn compared to US comparable level hotels, but otherwise, this is a lovely way to see a beautiful city. Hovever, I did get a few stares when I entered the bar with children to meet my husband. That is the clientelle, not the staff.p.s. Don't miss the Biodome and Insectarium! Especially if you have children. And for breakfast, go around the corner from the Ritz to Eggspectations! Excellent for quality, presentation, variety AND price!!\",\n",
       " \"A lot of positives regarding this hotel. I'll simply list them:1. Location, location, location. Enough said.2. Very good staff. With the exception of an understaffed breakfast one morning, everything was Ritz quality.3. Big rooms. My family of four (two young kids) stayed in a one bedroom suite that was huge. Plenty of room - hardly used the &quot;other&quot; room. Bathroom was big and well appointed.4. Great value. Family package included breakfast, movie (with popcorn - nice touch), welcome gift for kids (again - nice touch), valet parking and unlimited in-room games.I really enjoyed my stay at this hotel and definitely would stay there agin next time in Montreal. All the write-ups around a run-down hotel, at least to me, are very misleading (not that anybody reading this cares but I have stayed in at least 10 different RC's worldwide as well as plenty of other 5 star hotels worldwide). This is an older hotel, no doubt. But it is very elegant and has a grand feeling about it. I remember thinking that as I walked down the hall to my room. That said, onsite amenities were just ok - business center was small and basic, on site gym was small and basic (although access to full-service gym nearby is part of your stay), no gift shop (strange ?) and if I were prioritizing upgrades, I would redo the first floor - the lobby, lounge and dining room could use a better configuration (and throw in a gift shop !).\",\n",

Verry old mattress...you could see it as you entered the room that it was all &quot;wavy&quot;... We had a corporate rate at $175/night and was really not worth it. Go to the fairmont Queen Elizabeth.. it is a lot better..',\n",
       " \"I agree with several of the other reviews: the hotel has an old-world charm, but it does need a facelift. It's not in the league of the usual Ritz Carlton. But, then again, when they do finally upgrade the hotel, the prices will undoubtedly go up, too. So why not enjoy it for what it is and get a suite for the price of a standard Ritz Carlton room?I found the service here &quot;formal&quot;. But that's not unusual at any Ritz Carlton. One of the other recent reviews mentioned the &quot;French arrogance&quot;. The employees are Canadian, not French. They just speak the French language. Let's not blame the people of France for the arrogance of other people.\",\n",
       " \"While I was there, I got a chance to see a couple of other hotels. I was there for a wedding and during my trips to the other wedding-guests' hotels I was dissappointed that I had chosen the Ritz. Others would say &quot;Oooh! The Ritz! How posh!&quot;, and I would kind of grumble and nod my head, not able to say anything good.I had expected it to be luxurious, indulgent, exciting, with warm and happy staff, and delicious food. I had chosen it because sadly it was going to be the only getaway I was going to get as I work so much. The rooms, as the rest of this blog-thread says, are tired. The washroom was just surprising. I couldnt believe that a Ritz hotel would not consider renovating them as they look like they have not been changed since the hotel was built. The room was ok, the service was not as fast and &quot;giving&quot; and &quot;warm&quot; as I've experienced at other hotels... it just seemed cold and stiff, and not at all the relaxing convenient getaway that I had wanted... and my room service... the food was cold... my eggs benedict tasted funny... somewhat sour-ish... i think the ham had gone rancid... i was too embarrased to call them to bring it back...For the price, (it was the exact same price for the Intercontinental which was much nicer) I would not stay there again. I would go to a different hotel where I can feel as good as I need to when away from home and needing a break.\",\n",
       " \"Background: Traveled to Montreal with extended family. Booked 3 rooms at the Ritz on a buy-2-nights-get-one-half-off deal, so the rate was very competitive. The hotel was not full. They were filming &quot;No Direction Home,&quot; a movie about Bob Dylan on some of the floors. Our group has 3 rooms overall. Everyone enjoyed the stay and liked the Ritz. Ritz facilities: Based on the reviews on this site, I was a little learing about this hotel. I was pleasantly surprised. No, it's not a shiny new facility, but it is not shabby either. This is a place filled with old world charm -- think chandeliers and chinz. The toiletries were high end. The in room safe was roomy. There was good closet space.Service: The hotel even extended the famous Ritz hospitality to us, even though we were staying at bargain rates. Both kids got chocolate chip cookies (with their names on them) and apple juice delivered to the room. A nice touch. We ate in the hotel only once -- for breakfast. They were very accommodating. They did not charge for the kids and really seemed to take liberties with the menu (giving us way more, not less). We were a big group (but well-behaved). The presentation of the food was beautiful. The food itself was good, but not as good as the presentation. Breakfast at the Ritz is not cheap, but it is a really nice experience and a more reasonable splurge than dinner, I'm sure.Location: The hotel is fairly close to McGill, but is not that close to many of the toursity sites. It's not far from shopping (Rue St. Catharine and the underground city), but Vieux Montreal, the Old Port and the Basilica de Notre Dame are far.Overall, the Ritz is a nice hotel. I might prefer to be more centrally located, but if the price was as attractive as it was this time, I would probably stay at the Ritz again.\",\n",
       " 'This is a nice property, but definatly not a five star experience. We had a corner room with a fireplace. The room was pleasant enough, but it really needs a makeover. I guess they have not gotten the memo about replacing the old style bedding with nicer duvets. Also, the bathrooms are in need of some work. The marble is lovely but the fixtures are from the sixties.The staff is was very helpful and well trained.We stayed here because of a friends and family rate, so paying $90 a night was great, but it was really tempting to move over to the more up-to-date Sofitel.',\n",
       " 'We stayed at the Ritz Carlton for one night in August. In our previous trip to Montreal we stayed at the Fairmont hotel. Comparing these two hotels one can only conclude that the Ritz Carlton was probably a great hotel a while ago. The style and decor reminded us of a time gone bye, but if you like old world charm this may be the hotel for you. Unfortunately, the upkeep in the room we stayed in could have been better. There are no serious problems but for a hotel of such reputation one would expect more.The staff at the hotel is a mix of French arrogance and great service. The receptionist was very patient and innovative in finding another traveller in the hotel, but at the same time you feel some sort arrogance in their French mentality. All in all, a great experience to stay at the Ritz Carlton but I probably would not stay there again.',\n",
       " \"Stayed here with my mother and aunt (we took a room with two queen beds) back in mid-August. The price was reasonable and the location appeared to be nice.The room itself was somewhat faded, as was the lobby. I'm all for character, but even character needs a lick of paint and some upgrades. You got the sense that the wallpaper and covers needed bringing back into the last century at the very least. A few other comments: the outdoor tea was very nice and as we had great weather, very pretty. The gym was absolutely dreadful. Don't advertise a gym and put in 2 pieces of broken equipment and a few sets of weights. Either make people go to the gym down the road or improve your facilities. The bar was very comfy and the service prompt. Check-out was disorganized and clumsy but the concierge was very helpful. Montreal was a lovely city to visit - not sure I will head back - once is probably enough for me ... and the museums just up the road from the hotel are well worth a stop (check out the restaurant in the museum (whose name I've forgotten - museum of modern art? - very good food).The US$/CA$ exchange rate is getting more and more even - I imagine this used to be a very good destination for &quot;deals&quot;. Right now it isn't.\",\n",
       " 'Was unsure about staying here after reading TripAdvisor reviews. have stayed at many US Ritz Carltons. (The Ritz never returned my inquiry to a negative posting I read in TripAdvisor.) However, in our opinion, this is best location for a city stay. We booked two rooms and stayed 5 nights in July. Very quiet and within walking distance to restaurants and galleries. We easily walked across town to Old Montreal from the Ritz. Very close to the park as well. Is obviously an older building and the lobby is notthing to rave about, but rooms are what I would expect from Ritz Carlton; Large and brightly decorated with first class fabrics and large lighted closets, huge windows, marble and crystal in the baths. The only sign of wear is the bathtub drain. The staff was OK, very French -- but friendly enough. One or two of the staff always went out of their way to be extremely helpful. (But not the level of quality you see at Ritz in the US.) The hotel also has a hidden garden which is a gem in summer! (For business, the public meeting rooms are beautiful.) Compared to the other cookie cutter, high priced large hotel options, (I explored almost all of them) this was a gem. There are other boutique hotels which are new, trendy, not unaffordalbe which I would recommend. And a few charming properties in Old Montreal. But for the price we paid at the Ritz, it was well worth it and very memorable. Would definately not hesitate to recommend this hotel!',\n",
       " \"I wondered why the Ritz-Carleton was the only luxury hotel with space when I tried at short notice to book a suite for three people in Montreal and now I know why. We'd stayed there previously a few years ago and had been most impressed by the service and the attention the staff paid to our young daughter. This time the harrassed staff displayed indifference at best. I'd reserved a suite with two beds with a roll-up bed in the adjacent living room, for which I was paying $540 a night. When I shell out this kind of money I expect to be impressed but the opposite was true. There was no roll-up bed in the dreary and dusty living room, which looked as though no one had been there in years. A few chairs were clumped together at the window and the rest of the room was totally empty. It would be hard to conjur up a less welcoming scene. The two beds in the main bedroom were lumpy but we had more problems with the noise from outside. $540 a night only buys you a third-floor suite overlooking Sherbrooke Avenue, one of the busiest streets in Montreal. So all night there were various vehicles zooming by and when the bars emptied in the early morning hours, we were treated to shouts and hollering as drinkers made their way home. Breakfast in the cafe next morning took an age, not helped by the overworked and generally grumpy staff who seemed to regard guests as a nuisance. When the food did eventually arrive it was good but hardly made up for the 35 minute wait. Sometimes I think prestigious chains like Ritz-Carleton should encourage its executives to stay in their own hotels. That way we may see some improvements. My family certainly has no intention of ever setting foot inside this establisment again.\",\n",
       " \"What an experience; this hotel certainly makes the Ritz name proud! Staff were incredibly helpful, and the hotel was beautiful. We ordered espresso through room service one night at 3 am, and they were all out - they actually sent an employee out of the hotel to buy us coffee! The room was a bit small, but very luxurious. I expected more out of the bathroom compared to the opulence of the lobby and restaurants, but it was certainly clean and served it's purpose. I'd stay here again in a heart beat!\",\n",
       " 'the hotel is old and somewhat rundown--but the bed, linens,bath and noise levels were excellent--just what you most want in a hotel.

My reservations were already madewhen I came to this sight and read some of the recent postings on the tired, dirty, indifferently staffed place this had become. This was our first stay in Montreal and I wanted something nice. Glad I trusted my instincts. Our room was lovely and elegant,bathroom certainly wasn't anything I saw in the 60's and the staff couldn't have been more accomodating. Turn down service was always done while we were still out late, and maid service done reasonably early in the day ( I'm assuming, since we were out sight seeing.) We stayed on the sweet deal package that gave half off the third night, soit was certainly reasonble price. Maybe staying in an old, classic, elegant building isn't everyones thing, but if you've stayed at other Ritzes or Fairmonts or any lovely old place in say San Francisco or New Orleans, you wont be sorry.P.S. Had a great time seeing the sights...what a fun city. We'll definately be back.\",\n",
       " \"We almost didn't stay at the Ritz on our 3-night trip to Montreal (Jul 1-4) after reading all of these horrendous reviews. However, after coming to our senses....&quot;It's the RITZ for crying out loud, how bad can it be??!!&quot;...I'm so glad we did stay, and we had a very pleasant experience.Now - to set the record straight: with all due respect to those who have previously commented, I question if they are familiar with Ritz-Carlton properties in general. Historically speaking, the hotel brand is inspired by The Ritz in Paris and The Carlton in London, and is known for it's &quot;old-world&quot; charm, meaning that the decor of the hotel is very much that, as if you've just walked into the 19th century. Ritz properties, while having many amenities, are not supposed to look or feel &quot;modernized&quot;, so to speak, they should look and feel like a historically glamorous moment in time. To cut to the chase, they look old on purpose...! However, FYI - the last renovation to this property was in 1998, so it's not like they ripped off the wrapper last week, either. That said, it's a perfectly charming property in a great location with great service, as it should be at the Ritz-Carlton.All that said, the Ritz Montreal totally lived up to my expectations of a Ritz property. The staff was delightful from the moment we pulled up, and were very helpful with luggage, valet, check-in, everything one would expect. The room was perfectly fine; it was clean, well-appointed, and a nice size for a double bed room. The sheets were fine and of a decent thread count. Turn down service was good and housekeeping did a very nice job each day.A word about the bathroons: they do not look like they are from the 60's, ours didn't at least (rm 306, facing Sherbrooke). The bathroom was fine, nice size, and the the water was plenty hot with plenty of pressure. Plenty of towels, the robes, etc, all in place. The sink was deeper than 3 inches as previously stated. Now, it is not the prettiest bathroom I've ever seen, but it's basically grey and white marble for the most part, and with all of the amenities. I definitely didn't think 60's when I saw it.As far as pricing, the room rates are pretty reasonable (for a Ritz), and as for other things like valet and room service, of course it's overpriced, it's a Ritz! (just like in the States and everywhere else, you should feel right at home, lol).In sum, our stay here was a great experience -- and my friend and I are complete travel snobs, especially when it comes to hotels. Do not be hoodwinked by the others, you will be just fine here.\",\n",
       " \"Staying there for one night with an award gift cert. I would definitely not pay couple hundred bucks for this room. It's beyond tiring and old decor, I have seen better decor at Motel 6. The wall is super thin, we were put in the last room down the hallway and it's still noisy. The bathroom literally hasn't changed since 1960s. We asked for non-smoking room, but clearly this is not one. Bathroom also smells of mildew. However, the staff is helpful and the location is fantastic. The duck pond was a bit disappointed. Ritz Bar has very limited (and not so great) wine selection, so not sure what the big deal is. The next couple nights we paid to stay at the W hotel, and it's night &amp; day difference. I feel kinda bad for the staff as they tried hard, but this is definitely not a regular Ritz you would expect.\",\n",

We originally booked the Loews Hotel Vogue but the travel agents moved us to the Ritz Carlton at the last minute, which we were very disapointed about as we had reserched the Hotels in depth.The Ritz Carlton has a grand entrance and reception with friendly staff, but we did only speak to them when we checked in and out. When we got to our room we were quite pleasently suprised with the size of the bed and the room was ok but when we looked at the bathroom it looked like something out of the 60's!! For a five star hotel I would have thought the bathrooms would have been updated and modernised. We were also disappointed as the air con did not work. The hallways also looked a bit dated and tired.Don't have the buffet breakfast. It is $35 (Canadian dollars) each and it is not that special. For that price I expected far much more. I would not be at all suprised if you could get a far better breakfast for half the price if you looked. Still can't get over how the canadians/americans force everything on the one plate, you can come back you know!!!To conclude I think you could get a nicer hotel for your money, a bit like the breakfast!!\",\n",

There are plenty of dining and drinking options to suit every taste and budget just blocks away.

The room was ok, but the sheets were cheap, which seemed odd for a hotel in the RitzCarlton chain.Food in the resturants was expensive and not particularly good. Room service was outrageous...an order of coffee (good for about two cups) came luke warm and cost about $30 US.Parking was outrageously expensive as well.The hotel is located in what once was a relatively POSH part of the city, but the City, like the Hotel has seen better times. With some TLC, it could be quite a grand place to stay, but my wife and I found ourselves regretting not staying at one of the other grand hotels in Montreal every time we passed one that seemed bright, clean and modern.In short, for the price, and what you will spend on the ground, you can do better.\",\n",
       " \"The hotel is in horrible condition, looked never renovated since 1970 and for the same price or cheaper, you can find so much better in Montreal( Loews, Germain, Sofitel ...)Talking with a staff memeber, about the sad condition of the hotel, he told me that the only reason why this Ritz-Carlton was part of the U.S. Ritz-Carlton hotel chain is beacause US Ritz-Carlton cannot open other Ritz in Canada if they don't owned this Ritz in Montreal cause Ritz-Carlton Montreal were the first ever to have the name Ritz-Carlton hotel (in 1912) and has the exclusivity in Canada. Also, Ritz US have problems with the owner of Ritz Montreal that dosent want to put money in the hotel to renovate to keep up with Ritz US high standards. So Ritz US canot really let go the Ritz Montreal and the Ritz Montreal owner knows that, so they are &quot;playing&quot; like that, leaving the customer to a ugly old hotel. That staff member alos told me that the former general manager did renovate one bathroom as a model for further renovations and the owner was so mad about spending money for this, that he fired the general manager. The owner apparently has other buisness not related to hotels and uses the Ritz Montreal to loose money so he dosent pay taxes at the end with his other buisness. So beware if you plan to stay their, the owner dosent give a [--]about his guest/hotel so it will reflect in your satisfaction.\",\n",
       " \"This is easily the most down-market Ritz-Carlton I've ever stayed on. It reminded me of one of those dowdy hotels you see around train stations in London.Fortunately, the room was commensurately priced so I feel I got what I paid for, nothing more, nothing less.The one outrageous price was hotel parking. C$30/day! The only time where I remember paying more is at the Time-Warner building in NYC. If you stay at this RC because it's a good value, don't blow your savings on hotel parking. There are lots of parking garages in the neighborhood that are probably a lot cheaper.\",\n",
       " 'We stayed for one week for our honeymoon. The service was outstanding and the staff were pleasant and friendly. Lise in concierge was great, as well as Joseph and Luigi who was nice enough to surprise us with fresh baked cookies and chocolates. The hotel staff were very accomodating and each time we asked for something we got it with a smile. The room itself has antique furniture and and old world class, the Montreal Ritz was the first one ever built...it has a nice ambiance. The bathrobes and towels were warm and the slippers were toasty. They have very nice room service and their hamburgers are delicious. The only real improvment I could see is that the TV did not have any free movie channels. Overall, the hotel was romantic and we would stay there again.',\n",
       " \"I had to stay at this hotel one night in January for a business conference (my company chose it). Although it is a nice place with nice staff, I was dissapointed in my room. The heater would not stop pumping heat, even when I turned it down to 66 degrees. When I wanted to take a shower or wash my hands, I had to run the water for literally 5 minutes to get hot water. There were 3 phones in the room (weird) but no phone book. The guidebook in the drawer that described the services that the Ritz offered was generic and not specific to that hotel (i.e. it mentioned a gift shop and this hotel didn't even have one). The beds were nice with nice pillows, but the arm chair was pretty shabby. It wasn't all bad, though. Everyone was nice, there was excellent lighting and room in the big bathroom. Turndown service did a good job. All in all, this place doesn't live up to other Ritz Carltons, it is more like a Sheraton.\",\n",
       " \"My partner and I were guests of the hotel from November 10-14, 2005. This was our second visit to the Ritz in Montreal (see my previous review titled &quot;A Gracious Experience&quot;), and we have previously stayed at the Ritz in Washington D.C. multiple times and once at Buckhead (Atlanta). In December 2005, we were guests of the Ritz-Carlton Rose Hall in Montego Bay. I note these travel experiences for the purpose of context and because several reviews here opine that the Ritz Montreal is not up to the standards of the chain. We had a rate of $190.00 plus tax, which included valet parking and the American breakfast for two. The menu price for the American was $25.00 per person (juice, choice of eggs or griddle cakes, choice of sausages, bacon, or ham, garnished with potatoes and tomatoes, coffee, tea and a lovely basket of croissants, muffins and pain au chocolat). Parking in many Montreal hotels can run $20.00 - $30.00. We considered the rate outstanding value. The hotel is most definitely showing its age and is in serious need of refitting. Our suite, although not the impressive salon that we enjoyed on a previous visit, was still a nice size and well outfitted. The linens, bedding, toweling, robes, and toiletries were all to the Ritz standards. The bathroom, however, was a disgrace: peeling paint, stained wallpaper, a large mirror that was missing silver in many places, several cracked tiles, and a chipped enamel-over- steel sink. Similalrly, the maintenance of the dining room was poor: the windows were filthy with finger and hand prints and grime, the wall sconces were ALL askew, and the walls and wood trim were chipped and scratched.Since our last visit, the Universal-type weight machines in the gym has been removed, and only free weights, two treadmills, one step machine, and a bike were available.We also were put off by a large number of children and adults who were not registered at the hotel but were attending an audiiton. Many of these hopefuls filled the lobby and their presence diminished the Ritz experience. The service in the restaurant, bar, and at the front desk was still pleasing. Once again, we were delighted with the concierge. Tommy secured reservations at our e-mail request at two restaurants on the dates and times that we requested, even though they were heavily booked.As for comparisons to other Ritz hotels: This is difficult because the hotel is significantly older than the others at which we stayed. In terms of upkeep, I'd have to say that it is the worst. Not up to Ritz snuff. In terms of service, it comparable to the others, with the exception of Rose Hall, which is by far the very best hotel at which we've ever stayed anywhere. However, Rose Hall is a resort and, hence, comparisons are not fair. Interestingly, we are considering a possible trip to Philadelphia in August and a brief survey of reviews of the Ritz-Carlton there indicates that, at least in the in the minds of some, that hotel is not up to Ritz standards. We sould still return again if we could secure a good rate. The location is terrific, the hotel has clout with restaurants and other businesses, and there is a certain old world charm to the place.\",\n",
       " 'Trying to decide where to stay in Montreal can be difficult given the number of luxury hotels. Despite reading bad reviews of the Ritz, we decided to stay there over the Hotel St James, Hotel Nelligan or the Loews Vogue because of the price they gave us for a junior suite. Things were not perfect upon our arrival, after an 8 hour drive from Boston, in a snow storm. The woman at the front desk was not very helpful. I had requested a king suite, non smoking, high level. Our room had 2 queen beds, was on the 3rd floor and had a smoke smell. We were too tired to move or requst another room. In the end, the room was large, the smoke smell disipated and the bed was to die for.  It was holiday party time at the Ritz and the dining room was closed both Friday and Saturday nights. Certainly an inconvience for Friday night after our 8 hour drive. On a positive note, the bar was fun and lively, staff very nice, room service ok except for very cold toast ( $ 16) and the location was perfect. Would I stay at the Ritz again, maybe. It would depend on the rate which was very good for a hotel in Montreal. Loved the city, the food, and the beautiful holiday spirit of the city. We even found a wonderful non smoking French restaurant in Old Montreal!',\n",
       " \"This is one of the traditional grand hotels and an incredible bargain considering the level of service. I regularly travel to New York and Chicago and other major US cities, as well as Canada and can compare this hotel to others in its class. I agree with some reviewers that the rooms are a bit worn or natty in places. And I mean &quot;just a bit&quot;. Also, the plumbing fixtures and the A/C were just ordinary. But this is comparable to other old hotels I've stayed in. If you need an immaculate neat room, you need to stick with high end chains and you will pay much more for them. The level of service at the Ritz-Carlton was quite good. The daytime doorman was a bit stonefaced but I would overlook that for the high level of interest we received from everyone else. One of the things I like about older hotels like the Ritz Carlton is that they have real furniture, like solid wood chairs and side tables. Even the old fashion marble tile in the bathroom harks back to a kind of elegance not found in hotels in urban downtowns.We looked in the Ballroom lobby and Ballroom of this hotel, and they are stunningly elelgant. Beautifully appointed throughout. Look at the ballroom in a Hyatt or Westin. They're pathetic. The only hotels I've stayed in that compare with the Ritz-Carlton are the old CP hotels, like the Frontenac, Laurier and Empress. A handful of similar places survive in New York, Boston, Chicago and San Francisco. I travelled with two business companions and all three of our rooms were standard rate and were quite nice. I was on a smoking floor and it was too smokey smelling for me, but until Montreal realizes that, in general, they need to crack down on smoking in public places, this will be a problem in nice hotels and restaurants. Overall, for the current cost of staying at the Ritz-Carlton Montreal, it's an excellent choice for anyone who appreciates old style hotels.\",\n",
       " \"I stayed at the Ritz on this trip to Montreal, got a grear corporate rate. Based on some of the reviews, I was expecting a hotel using its name to make money. I was impressed with it however. Yes, the rooms are out of date (the desk in mine had to be at least 40 years old)... but everything is there. (except a coffee maker...) They only seem small because of the design, I found them fairly spacious for a vintage hotel. The high ceilings help with that. I notice someone mentioned the heaters a la Motel 6 - keep in mind this hotel opened in 1912, central heating didnt exist back them, it was likely radiators that were later replaced by a wall/window unit. There are more modern hotels for the same (or less) money in Montreal, but there is a special feeling about the Ritz. Palatial, majestic... good words to describe the rooms. The service is top-notch, I'm pretty sure I was checked out by the general manager as well. I will come back, only if I get a decent rate tho.\",\n",
       " \"Spent 4 days at the Ritz Carlton. The hotel is very close to the best shops in Montreal and good restaurants nearby. I stayed in a deluxe room that was spacious but I was slightly disappointed. Here's why:Bed - comfortable but the comforter could have been thicker and warmer.Antique Dresser - You had to wobble each draw in order to open and close.Overall condition of Furniture - Everything had nicks on it. I guess that is expected with antiques but I was not impressed.Bathroom - Shower, tub, and commode needs replacement. Everything looked worn out and the shower rod was slightly rusted. The water pressure was a little weak. Towels, soap, shampoo all outstanding.Carpet, ceiling, walls - okayRoom Service - Fantastic, great food and service I paid $170US not including hotel taxes and that is great for a Ritz Carlton. However, since Montreal is still relatively inexpensive I would try another hotel first before I stay here again. If I could not find a better deal, I would come back because the staff is exceptional!\",\n",
       " \"Just stayed at the Ritz Montreal. Our room was small and dated. The desk chair had stains on it, and the lighting in the bathroom was poor. However, the room and bath were immaculately clean. I'm a neat freak, and there was not a stray hair or any other usual hotel nuisance in sight. The concierge was helpful, but I agree with other users that the bellman could be replaced. I don't think he ever said one word to us-not the usual Ritz service. No one ever greeted us by our name, and the conceirge didn't remember us even though we went to him three nights in a row for dinner suggestions. That seemed to deviate from the usual level of Ritz service. However, we had high tea one afternoon, and spent a few evenings in the hotel bar, and found both to have good service and to be very pleasant. The only drawback is there are smokers everywhere, but that's Montreal in its essence. I think you would have a nicer stay at the Sofitel or W in Montreal, but not for the same price as the Ritz. We got a good deal on our room, so overall we were pleased with our stay.\",\n",
       " \"I went to Montreal to visit relatives with my family and I did not enjoy the Ritz so much. For starters, the bathroom had a leaky faucet and the leak where the water came out was black. Second, the price of the hotel was outrageous! Completely a rip off for a hotel of such an iffy caliber. Third, I've been to the ritz before, and it was only til now that I realized all the flaws. Fourth, the wndows were so weak I couldnt get to sleep from the noise. Literaly!\",\n",
       " \"My husband and I stayed at the Ritz Carlton for 2 nights and loved every moment. They upgraded us to a junior suite with a whirlpool tub. The room was enormous with beautiful crown moldings, canopy bed, jacuzzi tub etc. This was the 1st Ritz and is much different since it is a historical building. I like the design of the hotel though since evey room is different and not the same cookie cutter set up you get with some Four Seasons and Ritzs. Front desk, bar staff, and wait staff were very polite and accommodating. Door man always present and pleasant for directions, cabs etc. Did not deal with concierge, so I can't comment there. We had nothing but good service at the hotel. The delightful breakfast garden did have quite a wait, but the hotel was full while we were there, and it was worth the wait on a sunny morning. If you can afford to go for a slightly better than standard room, it will be worth it. I did hear the standard rooms were very basic and disappointing, but when rooms at a Ritz start from about 150 CAD, you still can't complain!\",\n",
       " \"Of course I've developed a certain expectation based on previous stays and various Ritz Carlton's. This is definately the worst one that I've stayed at. The rooms are very outdated. The bathroom was very dingy and needed to be remodeled. There is also a nightclub somewhere nearby that you can hear and feel at night from the 6th floor. That was very annoying when we tried to go to bed. In addition, the beds and pillows were not very comfortable. The staff was nice enough, although the conierges seemed a little rude. The location was pretty good. Close to shopping and the Metro - pretty central.\",\n",
       " 'We were somewhat concerned , after booking the Ritz at a promotional Rate, based on some of your reviews.The staff was incredible. Helpful, pleasant and willing to serve.

       " 'We originally booked the Omni in Montreal in favour of the Ritz based on negative reviews on this website.When we arrived at the Omni, the room was smelly and dirty so we went with the name we can always trust. The Ritz CarltonContrary to postings here the staff were extremely friendly and courteous, and always willing to help and offer advice on restaurants and things to do.This hotel is definitely worthy of the Ritz Carlton name and is on a par with others that I have visited.',\n",
       " 'We traveled with a 2 month old and a 2 year old and coming back to the Ritz every afternoon was such an oasis. We stayed in a deluxe suite on the 8th floor for 5 nights. The room was clean, large and elegant. (No carpet issues like others have mentioned) The hotel staff were very attentive and the concierges were life savers. This is an older Ritz without the amenities of some of the other Ritz properties but it was clean, relaxing and most importantly had the level of service you expect. I recommend this hotel and most definitely would stay there again.',\n",
       " \"We spent a long weekend at the Ritz in Montreal at the end of July. It was not up to the standard of other Ritz hotels we've stayed in. The corner room was okay although it seemed the interior decorator had forgotten one side of the room. The bathroom was marble but small and dark with grout peeling from the tiles around the sink. The staff was responsive to questions but no one went out of their way to be helpful. The doorman was usually absent. Food was not available after 11 p.m. in the lounge/bar which was disappointing and a glass of so-so wine was $15.00. The much hyped afternoon tea was only okay. We've had much better in other places in Canada and at $34 per person it was pricey for the quality. The hotel is located four blocks from the nearest metro station and then four stops to the hub where a change of trains is required to go on to the Old Town and Old Port sections of the city where many of the tourist attractions are located. It's only one metro stop to McGill so it is fairly convenient for the college if that's the reason for your stay. But, otherwise, it's a long commute and if it's at a time when people are traveling to events it will likely be done standing up hanging on to a pole. Montreal is an attractive, cosmopolitan city. We'll definitely return to Montreal but we'll find somewhere else to stay.\",\n",
       " \"I spent 6 nights here on business in a dark and cramped Jr Suite. On a non-smoking floor they allowed smoking, including cigars in small conference rooms and the smell premeated the entire floor. Staff was stuffy and the looks they gave customers they felt were under dressed or whatever was distainful and condesending. The doorman was absent as often as not. No pleasent &quot;Good morning!&quot;, no &quot;Welcome back!&quot;, nothing. The windows in the rooms were very small, making them dark and uninviting. The rather ugly, heavy, lifeless, formal decor did nothing to enliven them. The bath was large and possibly the best thing about the the entire hotel experience. Beds were good and housekeeping above average. Room service was friendly, but food only average. For a jr suite, the room was only the size of a large regular hotel room. Overall, very unimpressive for a Ritz hotel and I've stayed in a few. I travel to Montreal often and this was my first - and last stay here. i don't need to pay well and be treated badly. Montreal has way too many good hotels to waste your money here.\",\n",
       " \"I stayed at the Ritz Montreal with friends during Easter weekend, it was my first time to this location. Staff/Service:Arrival and check-in went without a hitch- car was valet-parked and the front desk offered us a room right away, even though we were early for check-in. The staff was a little cold, but hospitable. At times during our entrances and exits from the hotel, bellmen were not at their posts. Location:Very convenient- walking distance to Crescent St, shops on Sherbrooke, McGill University, &amp; St. Catherine St. Limited parking is available on the street, parking garages &amp; lots are abundant and inexpensive, valet parking is offered by the hotel. It's also right around the corner from my favorite breakfast place in Montreal, Eggspectations, so that was a bonus.Hotel room and lobby:Definitely has seen better days- I'm surprised this property is still considered part of the Ritz network, with their supposedly high standards. Carpets are worn, walls are faded, lights are dim. We stayed in a junior suite- both rooms are generous in size but the furniture sagged from many years of use. The bathroom is old and lighting is not great, but everything worked. We had to request additional towels, as only 2 were provided for 4 people staying in the room and they were brought promptly. If you are in the Ritz system, they capture all your preferences i.e. down blanket, chocolate covered strawberries upon check-in, turndown service, etc. These services were completed by this hotel so it was not like they abandoned the Ritz service philosophy; however, it is definitely not as opulent as other properties.All in all, an ok stay but not great. It is fine if you are just looking for a place to stay for a couple nights and for convenience, but if you are looking for luxury, I would look elsewhere.\",\n",

       " \"i stayed at the Ritz Carlton in May of 2005. I went there with my girlfriend, in order to have some fun, going to bars and shopping. I had called Jonathon Terninck (Guest Recognition Manager) and told him that i was 20 yrs old, staying at the Ritz Carlton and asking him if he could see past my age, and treat me like a 50 yr old executive. (i have previoulsy stayed at other Ritz Carlton's, and the staff was very rude to me). He said that he wouldnt treat differently than others. He was right. Jonathan helped me every step of the way: he gave me directions, gave me good pointers where to eat and shop, and where to find the best, classiest bars on St. Catherine St. The Ritz Carlton all in all was a great experience. The Hotel was extra clean, with perfect rooms. The amenities were great. My shoes were shined (complimentary), the room service was always prompt and well served. Parking was a relief and without a hazzle. I knew my car was safe in the underground, security gated parking lot. Concierge was also excellent. Tommy was a great help when it came to getting Museum tickets and directions around town.Tea time was also a great experience. The Ritz Carlton is renowed for their tea-time. Once again, this was a great experience. the Ritz Carlton Montreal exceeded my expectations.\",\n",
       " \"Travelling with two young boys - ages 6 and 1 is not always easy, but the staff at the Ritz-Carlton in Montreal made us feel so welcomed and spoiled. Upon arrival at our room there was a plate of large chocolate chip cookies personalized with their names written in chocolate icing, a gift bag with soft toy lions and a crib that looked as luxurious as our king-sized bed. In the evening a special bathrobe was presented for our 6 year old's use and rubber duckies to play with at bathtime. There was even a safety kit with night light, thermometer, Infant's Tylenol and band-aids. I was quite pleased at how family-friendly the hotel is. The perception that this is a stuffy, formal institution was shattered. Ritz-Carlton, Montreal is warm, eager-to-please, efficient and reliable.\",\n",
       " \"I expected the Ritz to be luxurious in an old-fashioned way and to have excellent service. It wasn't luxurious and the service was terrible. The place is old and dilapidated and the staff was useless. The rooms were decorated badly and the bathroom was one of the worst I have ever seen. Looks like someone re-made it in the early 1980s and it belongs in a fifty dollar-a-night motel. Also the food was exceptionally bad yet expensive. I had a mediocre hamburger, French fries that had been frozen and a glass of wine and my charge was almost $100 CAD. It seems that the reason the rooms are reasonably price is because they make all their money on room service. The price before tax for a room was very cheap at $139 CAD. My room service charge for the above mentioned hamburger and a bagel and juice in the morning was $170 CAD! The next morning I checked out and stayed at a lovely boutique hotel called the St.Paul hotel. I do not recommend the Ritz to anyone and I would never ever stay there again. I would never ever stay there again.\",\n",

This has to be the worst Ritz-Carlton in existance. I would suggest burning this hotel down before staying at it. The rooms suck, there is no gym or pool. The staff are bunch of stuck up French JOs who think they are superior in some way to their American guests that are paying their salaries. The wall paper was falling off the walls in my room and my friends were staying in a room where they received a breakfast menu from housekeeping that had the pages stuck together by chewed bubble gum! When we called the front desk they acted like it was no big deal and sent one up later when they got around to it. I grabbed a cup of coffee with friends in the lobby while waiting for another guest, when we went to leave I was nearly sacked by the bartender to get my room number to charge me, 12 cnd for three cups of coffee (no refills) at the Ritz-Montreal. I told the bartender this was the first hotel I had stayed where you cannot get a free cup of coffee in the morning, respose: a roll of the eyes. The food in the hotel was bad, we placed a room service order; of course when it came up it was the wrong order and we were told that we were mistaken and this what we ordered. I purchased a 1-day in room ethernet internet connection for 12.99, I was charged for it four times at checkout. They actually billed me for more internet hours than hours we spent as guests!This place is horrible, I would suggest one of the trendy boutique hotels in Old Montreal!',\n",

I'm taken aback by some of the comments on this site, I found the rooms beautifully furnished, large and filled with old world charm. Some areaas could be spruced up, the elevators are abit worn and outdated, but the amenities make up for it. The staff was outstanding and extremely knowledgeable. When I arrived I had a letter waiting for me from guest services wishing me a pleasant stay, also a message on the phone wanting to know if my room was in order and to my liking. Complementary coffee service was available each morning in the lobby as well as afternoon hot chocolate. Turn down service each nite, with chocolate on the pillows, was adelight, as well as complimentary shoe shine each evening. The hotel was small, probably the smallest in the Ritz tradition, but the price at 125 a nite was a steal.

Others would just say, I don't know - and walk away. Not what I was expecting from this hotel. The room was beautiful, but the carpets in the common areas desperately need to be replaced.

That said, we have nothing but positive things to say about the staff. From the doorman to the valet to the housekeeping; they were very pleasant and professional. We thoroughly enjoyed the Jardin restaurant. Price-wise, it's expected that everything costs more at this hotel so we were not at all shocked.

The bathroom was all marble, large and clean. There was a hair dryer, weight scale and great bath products plus a robe. There is a safe in the closet plus an umbrella, another robe and an iron and board.

I stayed there once more for a single night on business only because the rate was unbelievably low, and I thought I would give it another chance.

However, the negatives are numerous - let's start with out of date(not antique, mind you) furnishings that resemble scratched rejects from a Ramada Inn. The carpeting is worn down and appears circa 1978 - 1981 vintage. Room service is uninspired and the concierge advice was horrible. Our concierge tip for Chinatown dining was the Holiday Inn - no joke. This place needs a complete update.\",\n",
       " 'I will forever hesitate to stay at Ritz-Carleton since my stay in Montreal. There is an expectation associated with a brand name and Ritz-Carleton should be ashamed!',\n",
       " 'Stayed at the Ritz-Carlton Montreal on November 8-9 of 2002. Was upgraded at check-in to a junior suite (Room 607, if memory serves) with a view of the hotel gardens and the city skyline. I am told these rear-facing rooms are preferable to the ones that front directly on Rue Sherbrooke as the front-facing rooms can be noisy due to traffic 24/7 (Sherbrooke is a major upscale shopping thoroughfare--think Fifth Avenue or Rodeo Drive). The room was decorated in ruby red, forest green, and buttery yellow/gold with two large windows (blackout blinds and weighty damask curtains) and had THE most comfortable bed I have ever slept in (even better than the Starwood Heavenly Beds, in my opinion). The junior suite also featured a good-sized seating area with two chairs, a sofa, and a coffee table (the television was in a wall unit so that it could be rotated to face either the sitting area or the bed). The walk-in closet was spacious and contained the minibar and the safe. Off the closet was an enormous bathroom with a deep soaking tub and an abundance of towels. The staff always managed to address me by name (even in the elevators), was unfailingly polite, and always seemed eager to please. So solicitous of their guests were they that the young man who checked me in (Giuseppe?) stood outside and chatted with me at length on the day I checked out, wished me a safe journey, and graciously shook hands with me (as did the doorman). The in-room breakfast (American) was prompt, hot, and delicious (and very reasonable!). All in all, a class act on all fronts. I have been told by other friends that some of the standard rooms (280sq. feet) are somewhat less decadent (but by no means unpleasant), but with a mere $20-$50 CAD upgrade to a suite (460-600 square feet!), it is worth it if one wishes to truly experience the grandeur of this truly legendary property (the oldest Ritz-Carlton in North America still in existence).',\n",
       " 'We found true comfort at the RITZ. The staff is polite and helpful. The beds are giant and the sheets and down blanket buttery soft. The robes are plush and the marble baths super pretty. The hotel bar is open late and mixes incredible drinks (with glass stirrers). Hooray for this 1912 gem! I am so glad I did not heed the advice of the prior naysayers.',\n",
       " 'I was shocked at how shoddy the public areas of this hotel were. I walked in and walked out...so sad. I am certain it had its day.Also the people at the bar and restaurant were leftovers from a pantie raid -- god awful loud, vulgar, cheap... Need i say more?Get a suite at the Vogue which is just down the street if you like that area; but you must have a suite in the back because the front is noisy, or stay at the St James which is truly a luxury hotel except the rooms are tiny and trendy. However the service and public areas are impressive.',\n",
       " 'The Ritz Carlton is a favorite for our family; It can be relied upon for a certain level of service, quality of room furnishings and ambience. It is suprising that the company would allow its name on this property---it is nothing like any other Ritz we have been to and feels like a budget convention hotel. While the location is good, the entry window boxes haphazardly filled with supermarket-type mums and ferns gives you an idea of what you will find indoors. It is NOT a luxury hotel--maybe 20 years ago, but not now. I f you have stayed in a Ritz Carlton elsewhere you will be very dissatisfied.We checked into the St. James instead which is truly a luxury property in every way; indeed the most luxurious in Montreal (I looked at all of them researching a travel article.) It is meticulously maintained and the furnishings, rooms and public areas are sumptuous. The concierge, Guy, is the best we have encountered anywhere.The Nelligan hotel and its sister properties in Motreal are also good, moderately priced choices if the St. James is not in your budget.',\n",
       " \"I have nothing but praise for the Montreal Ritz. Many of the reviews posted here may make this property seem outdated, or of inferior quality. On the contrary, I have immensely enjoyed both my visits to this hotel and consider it my favorite hotel in one of my favorite cities. First, the service is unparalleled. The staff - from reservations, to the concierge, to the front desk - is extremely helpful, considerate, and hard working. They ask if they can help, go out of their way to get you things (the right room, reservations at restaurants, etc.) and are discreet in their efforts (I've stayed at places where the concierges have lamented over and over how hard it was to get reservations at somwhere or other - maybe expecting a huge tip?) This is the kind of place where,when you get off the elevators (that are directly across the front), a staff member will likely say 'good evening Mrs. so-and-so' - how they can remember each person's name (staying in rooms, not suites, no less) is beyond me. It isn't a vanity thing to have your name remembered, it's just something that makes you feel slightly less anonymous (you could say that considering the price they better - but how many other places do this with EACH guest? The Omni? The Intercontinental? anywhere else that's a high-end 'chain'?). Second, the actual hotel: This hotel is not large - it's exterior reminds me a BIT of the Ritz in London, but the lobby is more like the Berkeley Hotel in London - meaning that it's small, intimate, understated, and discreet. It is more like your wealthy grandmother's house - not spankng shiny new, yes a bit of fading in the rugs and maybe even a dent in the wood here or there. But it is LIVED in. This is a historical hotel - it is a place that has seen countless visitors over the years, yet has not succumbed to modern design ideas (Ian Shrager), and has not traded in original fixtures, etc. for shiny new replicas. I think that rather than scoff at this, one should celebrate it. This is a kind of place where money - old, unassuming, confident money - breathes. And even if you dont' fit into that category, you are treated the same. How do I know? I have stayed here twice. The first visit (Nov 2000), my mother and I were coming for a mother/daughter weekend. I'd ordered flowers to the room for my mother - the concierge helped me out a bit - very nice and reasonably priced arragnement (she asked my budget). I was discreetly asked what this was for and I mentioned an early birthday. When we got to our room not only were the flowers there, but also a very fancy dessert and note from the hotel wishing my mother a happy birthday. The concierge had also amazingly gotten us reservations at Toque - prime sitting and nice table - as well as an appointment to Spa Diva; on our arrival we were given appoinment cards and everything was set up - all we had to do was enjoy our time. The room itself was very nice - furnished with dark woods and plush carpets, bedding, etc. and the room itself was very large with a nice view; toiletries were great (they've since changed them - I miss the old ones but the new ones are a bit more Aveda-esque in that they follow the 'natural' school of formulation). We just got back from the second vist, in Nov 2003. This time, when I tried to order flowers, they asked what the occasion was - and I told them that my brother and I were bringing my mother there as she had just finished chemotherapy and I wanted some flowers to celebrate it. The reservations and concerige set up my room, flowers, dining, etc. On arrival, we were greeted with a 'welcome back Mrs. ___' (they must look these things up?) and taken to our room, which was booked as a junior suite, meaning one larger room with two beds and a seating area. What we got was a huge suite - two rooms, a bedroom with a humongous bathroom joined to an room equal in size to the bedroom that had a huge tv, video games, etc. with a sofa, several chairs, etc. We were shocked but apparently, we had been upgraded, Ritz style. I'm not sure (am strongly guessing) that this was because we had chosen this hotel to celebrate my mother's successful treatment, but I'm not sure. I have also heard that this hotel tries to upgrade frequent visitors, so maybe that was it (though twice in three years isn't that frequent, is it?) All I know is that, as typical, they surprised us once again with their kindness and thougtfulness. I cannot recommend this hotel strongly enough to anyone. In fact, this last time, we thought of staying somehwere else just to try a new place - perhaps one of the newer 'boutique' hotels but in the end, stayed here because of the price - equal if not cheaper than the others but yet we were getting the prime location, service, and familiar experience. Well this last experience cemented it - it wasn't the fact we got upgraded, just that, in this stressful time we truly felt that we were somewhere safe, home. And then I wondered - isn't that bizarre? we've only stayed here twice now - how can someone rationally feel that way? Well it is inexplicable I suppose but then maybe that in and of itself tells you something.I will never stay anywhere else in Montreal and strongly recommend that anyone reading this review try out the Ritz - if only more hotels could be like this...\",\n",
       " 'My husband and I recently stayed at the Ritz-Carlton in Montreal for a business trip and were very disappointed to say the least. The hotel was very outdated and is in need of a complete overhaul. The carpet was worn throughout the entire hotel, our room was decorated with what looked like second hand furniture and the bathroom looked like it had been decorated during the seventies (or early eighties). Our bed was the most uncomfortable bed I have ever slept in at a hotel and they did not have the trademark Ritz-Carlton featherbed and comforter. They were also rebuilding their garage next to the hotel and I was disturbed every morning by the sound of a jack hammer-which was so loud I could not even hear someone on the telephone. Instead of rebuilding the garage they should knock down the entire building and start over. The concerige service was terrible-half the time no one was even at the desk. The only good thing I can say was that the housekeeping service was great!! We have stayed at Ritz-Carltons in the past and this place was just not up to par, and everyone in our group agreed that we would never stay at this hotel again. Save your money for a stay at a REAL Ritz-Carlton-this hotel is certainly not it!!!',\n",
       " 'During my stay my room , which was cosy, was cleaned everyday, unless I asked them not to. We were offered a free continental breakfast on the weekend and the staff was very warm and made sure we were comfortable. The location was fantastic, we were walking distance for shopping and transportation was never hard to find when we needed it. Although it was a 2 star hotel, our service was better than a 4 star hotel. We had free internet and a mini fridge in our room. The 5 star hotels I have stayed in before alwalys have a fee for access of both these items. I would definately recommend this hotel for anyone staying in downtown Montreal!!',\n",
       " 'Dorion is easily the worst hotel I have stayed at. The last two days of my stay, they did not clean my room. Though they did service the room the first few days, they did not vacuum. Other problems included cheap furniture, thin walls and doors, smoke smell in common areas, hotel laundry visible to customers, and most staff does not appear to be trained in the hotel industry. Hotelling is about service. Dorion seems to have missed that. I can forgive a lot, but not cleaning the room is just not right. Only half the staff were friendly, the other half did not even respond to a friendly &quot;Bon Jour.&quot;',\n",
       " \"I did extensive research and waited until the last minute to book something because I wanted to see if I could get a good last minute deal. I could have stayed at other locations for cheaper but decided to stay at the Hotel Dorion because of the review before this one.The Good: The staff was extremely friendly. My other only experience with lodging in Montreal was at a B&amp;B and the owner was not as friendly as the staff at the Dorion. Also, the location was literally across the street from the Metro and there was almost no noise coming from the strip club under the hotel (even though my window was directly above the club).The Bad: The room we stayed in needed serious work, the sheets had cigarette burn holes in them and the bathroom room was boarded up. We did not ask to be moved to a different room because we knew the hotel was probably full of similar type rooms. Also, despite the fact that there were no smoking signs all around the hotel, two staff members smoked while they were working inside the hotel.This hotel is a European-type 2 Star hotel (you have to have traveled in Europe to know what I'm talking about). I gave the hotel a 3 star only because the staff was friendlier than most 2 star hotel staff but really the hotel is 2-star quality.\",\n",
       " 'I have been staying in the Hotel Dorion during all of my stays in Montreal for the last 15 years due to its convenient location in the Gay Village and because of its reasonable prices. During my recent stay at the Hotel Dorion, I was pleasantly surprised by all of the improvements in the hotel since my last visit two years ago. A new wing has been added which is nicer than the old section with its attractive, clean, modern rooms and with air conditioning. My room also had a refrigerator and a fabulous Jacuzzi. Other improvements are that the hotel now offers a continental breakfast on weekends, fresh coffee is available 24 hours a day and the hotel now has wireless Internet service. The most noticeable improvement is the competent new management of the hotel, especially Joanne, who is a delight to be around and who is completely on top of the situation. Raymond and Carlos were also very helpful to us and very friendly. The bilingual staff provided good service and a friendly atmosphere at the Hotel Dorion. Everyone that I encountered was very accommodating, such as helping me with driving directions or making sure that I have fresh towels and everything that I need in my room. I like the fact that the staff, obviously, cares about their guests. With the new improvements at the Hotel Dorion, I wouldnt consider staying anywhere else in Montreal. For convenience and service at a reasonable price, it is the best place to stay in the Gay Village. I would definitely recommend it to my friends!',\n",
       " \"even though this hotel is located directly above club taboo (gay strip club), it is very quiet. plus the staff members are very nice and the rooms are clean.. a metro (subway) station is located very close by as well as banks, grocery store, and of course gay clubs. old montreal and chinatown are within walking distance. my only reservation about this hotel are the staircases......they are fairly steep so you'll get plenty of exercise even while walking up to the front desk area. be sure to ask for a non-smoking room if you don't smoke.the hotel dorion is a good place to stay regardless of what your budget is.\",\n",
       " \"I stayed at the Hotel Dorion from Christmas through the New Year 2006 and I believe it was a good value the price..The 24/7 staff was very friendly, it has a secure entrance that you have to buzz to gain entrance..It is within walking distance of the Gay Village..The linens were clean, there is no room service, but they will exchange towels, sheets, etc. if you bring them to the front desk..They have a continental breakfast on weekends which is ok because there are some great restaurants nearby..The Metro Papeniau is across the street, a supermarket on the corner, a Drugstore on another corner, The Taboo [----] club and bar downstairs..The showers can however be kinda tricky with the hot water adjustments..I am returning this winter and I will be staying in the new addition..The rooms are suppose to be larger and quiter..We'll see..\",\n",
       " 'The Hotel Dorion was quite nice, seemed to be recently remodeled, bathrooms were new, and there were no problems with noise from the bar downstairs from the 3rd floor, which is where I believe all the overnight rooms are located. The A/C in the room was provided by a window unit which was noisy but not any more so than units I have owned in the past. The staff were very pleasant. However the room absolutely reeked of tobacco smoke, to the point that I had difficulty breathing and felt really sick at points. To be fair the hotel has no-smoking signs plastered all over the place, so this is mostly a case of the patrons being . However one would think they could install those very sensitive smoke detectors as they have in airplanes or take some other kind of measures to solve this problem. In any case I would recommend this as a great budget hotel for those who smoke or live with a smoker and are used to the smell. Otherwise, look elsewhere.',\n",
       " \"Located in Montreal's gay village, and above a male dancer bar, this hotel is popular with gay men. Whilst the music from the bar downstairs was not loud, this isn't a quiet hotel - 'though you can certainly get a good night's sleep okay.  The gay village is buzzing with bars, clubs and restaurants so this is an ideal location for anyone on a budget like I was ($60 Canadian) wanting to be able to walk back after 3am.  The room was adequate. Clean room and linen, comfortable bed and enough space. Color TV with cable channels, air conditioning, telephone in the room. The ensuite bathroom was very small with a shower but, again, adequate.  You enter the hotel by a buzzer at the front door, reception is on the second floor. Video cameras monitor all coridoors which are clean and well lit.  Breakfast is only available at weekends, but there is a fab. cafe just across the road. Subway is just one short block from the hotel. Nearest bar is ten yards from the hotel.  Hotel address: Hotel Dorion, 1477 Dorion, Montreal H2K 4A4. Tel. ------------ or toll-free ------------\",\n",
       " \"Everything about this hotel was simply divine, I have nothing bad to say about it what-so-ever. It's gorgeous, and it has very well-trained staff, and the food is amazing. It's ramontic elegance, with modern chic added in. Exquisite.\",\n",
       " \"Simply superb! Couldn't ask for better service or more comfortable accomodations. My wife loved the Molten Brown bath products, our suite was spacious and melded the old and new seamlessly. Situated in an old bank building, Le Saint James features high ceilings (12 feet?) and period architectural details combined with modern amenities...and it all works spectacularly. Well worth the stay, especially if you can get a deal for a little more than $200/night, as we did. And, the hotel's restaurant, XO, is very good.\",\n",
       " \"This building is grand, intimate and old. But it is so completely renovated. For example, in the room by every phone there is a master controller for all of the lights, temperature, etc., so you don't have to get out of bed to control the temperature. The room is really spacious with very tall ceilings and ornate molding is everywhere. But the decor isn't victorian or dated, it's like if you combined a W hotel with a Fairmont.It's rated four star, but I think it's a five star. Especially the spa. When I got to the spa, the therapist said, &quot;we'll be going into the vault&quot;. The massage room is literally inside a safe, but it's not claustrophobic. There is a lit floor (lighting is dim and amber) and the walls are really aged brick. It's the best spa I've ever experienced in terms of cool.Pricing is extremely reasonable for what you get. Room service is fast and accurate. The potatoes would be my only complaint but big deal.Oh the restaurant is spectacular. Huge, ornate staircase and opera balconies, but with neon lighting effects where the colors blend and change every few minutes. That restaurant would be a great place to have a wedding or reception. This is just a great hotel.\",\n",
       " \"we've been treated like queen and king as we walked thru the main door! our stay as been wonderful! all the staff is very friendly and make you feel good! the restaurant was an indescriptible experience for epicurians like we are!\",\n",
       " 'My friend and I stayed at the St James for 2 days after a cruise. We shared a room on the 7th floor for $200 a night through Expedia. The room was lovely with upscale amenities such as slippers, robes, heated marble floors in the bath and evening turndown service with chocolates. The beds are comfortable with a down cover and soft pillows. Our room did not have a bathtub and the shower, while large has an annoying lightweight curtain that wraps itself around your wet body as you shower. Breakfast was expensive $32 for lox and bagels with coffee and juice. A better solution is the Eggspectations Restaurant down the street for $8. The hotel is located close to the museum, shopping, and the Old City. Coffee and tea are available in the morning with newspapers in the library. The bar is lovely at night with lights that change that highlight the high ceiling. On the negative side, I found the traffic noise from the windows in our room irritating and the front desk failed to tell us that we needed to leave our key in the morning at the desk or we would not have room service. I needed to use the Internet for a web conference and found the codes for access did not work. While the correct codes were finally found by calling the service provider it took 20 minutes before the manager was able to get the issue resolved. The Internet is free and is fast. If you need to do any business while in Montreal I would stay somewhere else as the hotel is not equipped for business travelers (or they do not expect you to do business). The bell men are wonderful and attentive in handling luggage and answering questions.',\n",
       " 'We had a difficult time hailing a cab when we left on Sunday; no problem, one of the doorman ran down to a busier street, hailed a cab, got in it and rode it back to the hotel for us. Talk about service. The hotel itself is beautiful, the rooms are huge &amp; elegant, but with all the modern conveniences you would expect from a top end hotel. The staff was incredibly friendly and helpful. The restaurant XO, if oddly outsized in proportion to the hotel is beautiful, and we could have easily spent all afternoon there drinking wine and relaxing. The hotel has a very private feel to it which explains why it is favored by celebrities, of which one was staying while we were there. While we didnt love Montreal we would return for the hotel itself.',\n",
       " 'That is the only word that can come close to describing the experience of this fabulous hotel. There can no possibly be another hotel to compare with the charm, refinement, service and staff attitude than at Le St-James. The staff actually thinks and anticipates your requests. Rooms a generously sized .. bath is perfect and quality and selection of amenities are excellent. Small breakfast buffet is perfect and ambience is better. You will not have enjoyed Montreal if you do not stay at this gem. We paid about $200 and I have never been as satisfied nor have I been as reluctant to leave a hotel. We will be back!don.brown@brownchild.com',\n",
       " \"My husband &amp; I stayed here 2 nights in September for our anniversary. The service is truly remarkable; the staff are all professional and courteous. The building is beautiful and our room was very nice. We stayed in one of their basic rooms and found it to be quite large and comfortable. The bathroom was roomy with a separate tub and large shower with multiple shower heads and great water pressure. The dining room was closed for renovations so we didn't eat at the hotel (it re-opened the day after we left). We had a couples massage and I highly recommend their spa experience. The spa is beautiful and the atmosphere truly one of the best I've experienced. The location of the hotel is quite central to all. We live in the Montreal area and knew we could walk to most attractions, restaurants we wanted to visit. It was expensive but you do get what you pay for here. The one item I found a bit off was the amount they charged for parking but it would not deter me from staying again.\",\n",

We were dressed casually ( very casually!!) but we were treated exactly as well as the other guests who were dressed impeccably and on their way to the penthouse. This was just the introduction to one of the most delightful relaxing weekends I have had in years! We were spoiled- all of the staff spoke to us by name and any questions, or more importantly, recommendations and reservations for dining or entertainment were taken care of for us by the very approachable concierge. Turndown was perfect, our room was kept impeccable and I have not slept as deeply as I did this weekend since before I had children! This was an A++++++',\n",
       " 'This hotel is a real gem. It is small and tucked away on a busy corner, but boy does it have a lot to offer. Starting with the doorman Martin, all the way through the entire staff, this hotel aims to please. The lobby is elegant and offers tea and coffee in a gorgeous library. The rooms were amazing -- large and decorated with very old world style in keeping with the building and sleekly modern skillfully mixed in. The bathrooms were stunning with one of the best showers I have ever had. I also understand the restaurant is one of the best in Montreal. Unfortunately it was closed for renovations on our visit, but looked like an extraordinary room and is said to have fabulous cuisine. And the spa is worth a trip even if you opt not to have a treatment there -- it is a gorgeous room worthy of a picture on its own. The hotel is located in proximity to several wonderful restaurants and sightseeing areas. I cannot say enough about this hotel ,and while our stay was short, I plan to rectify that and return for a longer stay to better enjoy the property.',\n",
       " \"Just stayed at the St.James for 3 nights. Very friendly, courteous staff . I paid a little over $200/night on Expedia, a relative bargain for this hotel. I also received a much appreciated upgrade to a junior suite which was a very nice room. The restaurant in the lobby of the hotel is closed and under construction for another few weeks which is probably why the rooms were inexpensive. No matter. The only time you heard noise from the construction was in the lobby at the front desk which is right near the entrance to the restaurant. I don't know if noise can be heard from the lower floors in the hotel as I was up on a higher floor. Check with the hotel regarding this. The hotel's 5 star status does draw a little &quot;snobby&quot; type of customer, but that is expected. The only problem we encountered was the first night we couldn't get the room to cool off properly although the a/c was turned way down. The hotel sent someone up and unlocked the windows which solved the problem. The other nights the air in the rooms was fine.All in all, great hotel,especially if you can &quot;steal&quot; a room for under$250/night.\",\n",
       " 'Everything was lovely!!! Rooms &amp; Decor was absolutly marvelous. Best Housekeeping staff I have ever seen...People are very welcoming and are always there to help you.

The Hotel Le St-James is an outstanding guest service provider. It is only because of the htoel's physical attributes (i.e., swimming pool, etc.) that hinders them from receiving the fifth and highlest level. Every guest is greeted by name, escorted to their guest room upon check-in, and pampered throughout their stay. The rooms have very high ceilings.
