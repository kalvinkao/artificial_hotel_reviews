# Automating Fake Online Reviews
This project was built for a Natural Language Processing course in my master's program-- please find the final report [here](https://github.com/kalvinkao/artificial_hotel_reviews/blob/master/Automating%20Fake%20Online%20Reviews.pdf).

Since I am still working full-time while in school part-time, I am unsure if and when I can clean up the code to be more presentable.  My Google Cloud ML Engine training packages are located in the 'models' folder.
