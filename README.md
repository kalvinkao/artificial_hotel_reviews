# Automating Fake Online Reviews
This project was built for a Natural Language Processing course in my master's program-- please find the final report [here](blob/master/Automating%20Fake%20Online%20Reviews.pdf).

My final training packages (code with tensorflow) are located in the 'models' folder.  Since I am still working full-time, it may take me some time to reorganize these folders and clean up their notebooks and code.
