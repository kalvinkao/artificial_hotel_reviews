# Automating Fake Online Reviews
This project was built for a Natural Language Processing course in my master's program-- please find the final report [here](Automating%20Fake%20Online%20Reviews.pdf).

My final training packages (code with tensorflow) for the baseline models are located in the 'models' folder.  Notebooks testing the generative adversarial network model, as well as the notebooks analyzing the character embeddings of the baseline models, are located in the 'model_dev' folder.  Since I am still working full-time, it may take me some time to reorganize these folders and clean up their notebooks and code.
